<center><h2>Open Camera Device Compatibility</h2></center>
<hr>

<p>&lt; <small><a href="index.html">Main Page.</a></small></p>

<p>This page provides some guidance on possible issues of Open Camera on various Android&trade; devices. Please note the following:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Sometimes behaviour can be affected by things like operating system version or can differ between variants of the same
                model. Behaviour may also change over time depending on different versions of Open Camera, and different
                versions of device operating system. So something listed here isn't a guarantee of that behaviour on a
                particular model.</li>
        <li>This information is provided "as is" with no warranties - if you need to be certain of how Open Camera works on a
                particular device, ultimately you'll have to test it yourself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General notes</h2>

<p>If you're just interested in taking photos with non-advanced features (without using "Camera2 API"), then most things
        should work on most devices, as far as I can tell. I do occasionally get bug reports of things which seem to be device
        specific, but not enough to draw conclusions about things not working on particular devices. The most commonly reported
        issues seems to be:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Video is one of the most difficult things working across different Android devices - on some devices recording comes out
                corrupted. In some cases this is only on some resolutions, or it may be
                all.</li>
        <li>If you're wanting to save to external SD cards, you'll need to follow the advice at
                <a href="http://opencamera.org.uk/help.html#faq">the FAQ</a> . Note that in some cases, it seems that SD cards
                can't be selected even when using the Storage Access Framework option - this is a device issue, and
                something out of my control. If you're wanting to have lots
                of storage for taking photos or videos, it's probably better to make sure you get a device with plenty of
                internal storage (internal storage is faster anyway, so means faster taking of photos, and more reliable high
                resolution video recording).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested in enabling Camera2 support for advanced features (manual focus, manual exposure, expo bracketing, HDR),
        be aware that some devices have poor support for Camera2 (even if they support the API, the
        implementations seem to have problems). Thankfully things seem to be improving on that front with newer
        devices. Please read the details below on what I know about different devices.</p>

<p>Also note that just because a manufacturer advertises a particular camera feature, it doesn't mean that Open Camera can use
        it. Unfortunately some manufacturers limit some features to the "stock" camera application, and don't make it available
        through to third party cameras. This tends to be more advanced features - 4K video, high photo resolutions, high frame
        rate video, RAW.</p>

<h2>Device specific notes</h2>

<h3>Google Nexuses/Pixels</h3>

<p>In general, Google Nexuses have worked well for Open Camera. Firstly because Google provide good support for their own
        Android camera API, both old and Camera2 (as you'd hope!) - and they use it for their own Google camera. Secondly because
        I've owned several Nexuses (Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 7, Nexus 6), and so have been able to test Open Camera against them.</p>

<p>Camera2 on the Nexus 6 works well (there are some minor issues, e.g., manual exposure doesn't work well when recording
        video). It's hard to be sure about other Nexuses though.</p>

<p>In theory all this should apply to the Pixels, but I haven't been able to test - though from what people tell me, things
seem to work including Camera2 features. Open Camera also supports Google's HDR+ mode on the Pixels with Pixel Visual Core.</p>

<p>Color effects don't work on the Nexus 7.</p>

<h3>Huawei</h3>

<p>I've had reports of expo bracketing and HDR in Camera2 mode not working properly on some Huawei devices
        (Huawei P8 lite 2017, P9). See <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/tickets/368/">here</a> for details.</p>

<p>I've also had reports of RAW/DNG images being saved with red/blue swapped. See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/tickets/422/">here</a> for details.</p>

<h3>Lenovo Vibe S1</h3>

<p>A special prize goes to this device - several people have told me they can't even install Open Camera (Google Play
        gives error 504) on at least some versions of this device. This appears to be due to a pre-installed app "Stereo Verify"
        that clashes with Open Camera's package name (net.sourceforge.opencamera), which prevents installation of Open Camera.
        Also see
        <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/vibe-p1/help/stereo-verify-t3454811">here</a> for further discussion.</p>

<h3>Nokia</h3>

<p>I've tested Open Camera with the Nokia 8. Everything seems to work as far as I can tell, including Camera2 API with full
manual controls, RAW and 120fps video.</p>

<h3>OnePlus</h3>

<h4>OnePlus One</h4>

<p>A reported problem for third party camera applications (including Open Camera) is photos coming out with a "split exposure"
        effect where one half is brighter than the other - e.g., see
        <a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/half-split-photos-workaround-read-this.253160/">here</a>.</p>

<h4>OnePlus 3T</h4>

<p>This is a device I own, so has the advantage that I've been able to test with it.</p>

<p>Mostly things work fine, but Camera2 API has some issues:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Manual exposure sometimes fails (the preview corrupts or the device may freeze for a few moments), this also
                includes HDR.</li>
        <li>Low light scenes show the wrong ISO and shutter speed, both on-screen and in the saved Exif info (although the
                photos themselves still come out okay); also a knock on effect of this bug is that HDR and expo bracketing
                don't work in low light. Manual ISO also doesn't work above 799 (the images still come out with ISO at 799).</li>
        <li>High speed (120 fps) frame rate doesn't work.</li>
</ul>

<p>See <a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/camera2-api-bugs-for-3rd-party-camera-apps.506100">this thread</a> for more
        details.</p>

<h4>OnePlus 5</h4>

<p>This seems to have the same problems with Camera2 API as the OnePlus 3T (see above). Issues with RAW images have been
        reported for third party camera applications - see
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/discussion/general/thread/0a9b5bef/">here</a>,
        <a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/pink-tint-on-dng.562049/">here</a> and
        <a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/raw-camera-purple-halo.565588/">here</a>. As of August 2017,
        <a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/pink-cast-on-dng-files-when-shooting-with-other-apps.580035/">this
                seems to have been fixed</a>.
        But as of December 2017, there seem to be
        <a href="https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/raw-pictures-with-third-party-camera-app-are-greenish.727594/">additional
                problems with RAW on Android 8.</a>
</p>

<h3>Samsung</h3>

<p>I have tested Open Camera on a Samsung Galaxy S10e (Exynos SM-G970F). Mostly things work, including with Camera2
        API. Known issues are:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Slow motion and high speed frame rate video doesn't work (see below for more details).</li>
        <li>The maximum manual shutter speed allowed for third party camera applications is 0.1s (most devices
                seem to allow at least 0.5s).</li>
</ul>
<p>Both rear physical cameras are available to Open Camera; also the two modes for the front camera ("cropped" and
        "wide") are available to Open Camera.<p>

<p>More generally I have occasionally tested on various Samsung devices using their remote test labs - although useful, this is limited
        compared to owning a real device (especially when the test labs are dark!)</p>

<p>A few Samsung devices have shown problems with corrupted video recording with Open Camera, though this seems to be rare (and doesn't
        seem to be consistent enough to name any particular device - my S10e seems fine).</p>

<p>I've had reports of the audio being out of sync with video on the Galaxy S7 and S8 when in Camera2 API mode.</p>

<p>Older Samsung devices (e.g., Galaxy S5) didn't have 4K video recording available for third party camera applications. In some
        cases it could be enabled with the "Force 4K" option, but this only works on some devices (in some cases whether it works
        depends on which variant of a device). As of the Galaxy S10e at least, 4K video is available.</p>

<p>Some Samsung devices do not have any "scene modes" (in some cases this can depend on even which variant of a device is
        used).</p>

<!--<p>I've had reports of picture quality being poor on Camera2 API the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, though improvements were made in
        v1.42.1 onwards of Open Camera. See
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/discussion/general/thread/48bd836b/">here</a> for details.</p>
-->

<p>At least some Samsung devices don't seem to have support for high speed frame rates for video for third party camera applications.
        Filmic have documented issues for the
        <a href="https://filmicpro.helpscoutdocs.com/article/41-samsung-s9-and-s9-filmic-pro-v6-compatibility-guide">S9 and S9+</a>, and
        <a href="https://filmicpro.helpscoutdocs.com/article/42-samsung-note-9-filmic-pro-v6-compatibility-guide">Note 9</a> (these articles
        are for Filmic Pro, but the issues faced likely affect all third party camera applications, including Open Camera).</p>

<p>On a positive note, the Galaxy Note 4 and 5 were used with Open Camera to film
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/blog/2015/10/cai-lan-gong---worlds-first-feature-film-shot-with-a-smartphone-at-4k-resolution/">the
                world's first 4K feature film shot on a phone</a>.</p>

<h3>Sony Xperia</h3>

<p>To enable the 23MP photo resolution, you need to set Settings/"Camera API" to "Camera2 API". Someone has reported to me this works on the
        Sony XA1 (G3123) (Android 8), I'm not sure about older devices.</p>
<!--<p>23MP photo resolution isn't available, the maximum seems to be 8MP. This seems to be due to
        <a href="http://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z5-Z5-Compact-Z5-Premium/Full-camera-res-in-third-party-apps/td-p/1045437/highlight/true/page/4">Sony
                not making this available for third party camera applications</a>.</p>-->

<p>Sony devices <a href="https://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Software-Updates/Camera2-API/td-p/974742/page/122">don't seem to support
        RAW/DNG</a> at the time of writing.</p>

<p>I've had a report that manual white balance temperature doesn't work (Sony Xperia X Compact).</p>
