Version 1.48.1 (2020/05/02)

FIXED   Crash on devices with Camera2 API where camera reports no picture, video or preview
        resolutions, instead fail to open camera gracefully instead.
FIXED   Fix switch camera buttons behaviour if a camera with ID greater than 0 failed to open.
FIXED   Some devices lost custom video profiles in 1.48.
ADDED   If camera fails to open, display ID of current camera that we tried to open.

Version 1.48 (2020/04/22)

FIXED   Taking front camera photos with frontscreen torch was slow.
FIXED   When using "Pause after taking photo", touching to unpause no longer
        triggers auto focus, or taking another photo for "Touch to capture".
FIXED   Take photo widget issue.
FIXED   Camera specific hardware keys such as volume keys shouldn't take effect in settings etc.
FIXED   Don't set optical image stabilization if video digital stabilization is enabled in video
        mode.
FIXED   Seamless video restart on maximum filesize (for Android 8+) wasn't broadcasting video files
        except the last one, meaning they were taking longer to show up in mediastore gallery.
FIXED   Recording video on Android 8+ could leave zero-size files if size approached the maximum
        filesize, but a restart did not occur.
FIXED   Problem of on-screen level angle overlapping with shutter icon when using a widescreen
        preview aspect ratio.
FIXED   Incorrect layout for on-screen text when using "icons along top" with wide-screen aspect
        ratio and device held in upside-down landscape orientation.
FIXED   Focus seekbars overlapped with histogram in widescreen aspect ratio when using "Icons along
        top" UI placement.
FIXED   Was incorrectly offering manual white balance even if camera didn't support this
        (inconsistency that the manual white balance option showed, even though the manual white
        balance temperature seekbar wasn't shown).
FIXED   Optional on-screen icons (such as flash, RAW) weren't updating correctly if switching to a
        camera that didn't support that feature.
FIXED   Don't show on-screen flash icon in video mode (since this icon doesn't support torch, and
        flash auto/on not supported in video mode).
FIXED   Preview texture buffer size (for Camera2 API) could be set incorrectly after changing aspect
        ratios.
FIXED   Auto-level photos could never be full resolution (for when angle was 0).
FIXED   Update on-screen time format more often when changing device settings.
FIXED   USB/bluetooth keyboard control bug when navigating popup menu, if icons were displayed with a
        horizontal scrollbar.
ADDED   New icon for switching between multiple cameras. If your device has multiple front and/or
        back cameras, then the existing icon to switch cameras will switch between the first front
        and back camera; the new icon will instead cycle between the multiple front or back cameras.
        If you prefer the old behaviour, then disable
        Settings/On screen GUI/"Multiple cameras icon".
ADDED   Current camera ID now displayed on-screen (next to date/time) for devices with multiple
        front/back cameras. This can be disabled under Settings/Camera preview/"Show camera ID".
ADDED   Aperture control, for devices that support this. (Camera2 API only.)
ADDED   Flash on and torch now supported for manual ISO/exposure.
ADDED   Option to specify REC709 or sRGB profile for video recording.
ADDED   New custom gamma profile option for video recording.
ADDED   New video profiles JTVideo, JTLog and JTLog2 (thanks to JT Haapala).

ADDED   More zebra stripe values 93-99%.
ADDED   Options to control zebra stripe colours.
ADDED   Option for storing device's current yaw/pitch/roll in Exif user comment for photos (thanks
        to Joshua).
ADDED   New option Settings/More camera controls/"Allow long press actions" to disable long press
        actions.
UPDATED Auto-level feature now shows on-screen rectangle to show the frame of the resultant photo.
UPDATED Improvements for log profiles for video recording. Please note that this means the behaviour
        of these profiles has changed!
UPDATED On devices with on-screen navigation buttons, camera preview can now display under these
        buttons if required for wide aspect ratio (requires Android 5+).
UPDATED New immersive mode option to hide navigation buttons only when in immersive mode; existing
        option for hiding navigation buttons now renamed to say "dim".
UPDATED Show toast with camera id on startup if camera isn't set to the default camera for front or
        back facing. Toast for cameras also displays whether ultra-wide, when using Camera2 API.
UPDATED HDR and NR photo modes now limited to maximum resolution of 22 megapixels (to avoid risk of
        running out of memory on devices with large camera resolutions).
UPDATED Improved performance when displaying ghost image larger than device's resolution.
UPDATED Popup menu now displays extra information for resolutions (MP for photos, descriptive name
        like FullHD, VGA etc for video).
UPDATED Don't set video digital stabilization when in photo mode.
UPDATED Some preferences are now showed disabled if only relevant for another nearby option that
        isn't currently enabled.
UPDATED Moved video bitrate and frame rate options to debugging section.
UPDATED Improved UI support for "external" cameras (if detected/supported with Camera2 API).
UPDATED Improved placement of on-screen text (zoom, video recording time etc) to avoid focus
        seekbars in landscape mode.
UPDATED Improved look of on-screen text for manual/exposure sliders.
UPDATED Exposure icon now highlights red when exposure UI is open.
UPDATED Exposure UI now auto-opens when switching to manual white balance (as exposure UI contains
        the manual white balance temperature seekbar).
UPDATED More repeat mode options (100x, 200x, 500x).
UPDATED Optimisation for reading most recent photo/video for thumbnail.

Version 1.47.3 (2019/10/20)

FIXED   Grids were being drawing too faintly.
UPDATED Camera2 API is now a "list" selection rather than a boolean switch.
UPDATED Updated some icons for newer more consistent material design look.

FIXED   Some devices (e.g., Samsung) played shutter sound etc when Camera2 API enabled even when
        phone was on silent/vibrate.
FIXED   When using "Icons along top" UI placement on devices with notches/cutouts, on-screen text
        could be covered up by icons in widescreen aspect ratios.
FIXED   Don't display ghost image whilst frontscreen flash is enabled.
FIXED   Info toast string for video mode could be too long in some cases for high speed frame rates.
ADDED   Support for EXTRA_DURATION_LIMIT, EXTRA_SIZE_LIMIT, EXTRA_VIDEO_QUALITY for when called from
        video (ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE) intent.
UPDATED Minor performance improvement for panorama.

        crashed).
FIXED   Crashes related to histogram, zebra stripes, focus peaking - don't crash if we have
        problems.
FIXED   Don't close Open Camera if bluetooth service (for remote control) fails to initialise.
FIXED   Crash related to focus assist if camera closed.
FIXED   Crashes related to multiple instances of Open Camera and Renderscript.releaseAllContexts().
FIXED   Some devices (e.g., LG G6) defaulted to front camera, hopefully fixed to default to back
        camera on all devices that have a back camera.
ADDED   New panorama photo mode (requires Android 5+, note not all devices are supported).
ADDED   New option Settings/Photo settings/Text style/"Text with shaded background" for photo stamp
        option, to draw with a rectangular shaded background (i.e., bringing back the old behaviour
        that was replaced by the newer outline shadow text).

UPDATED Set navigation bar colour to black (needed for some devices, e.g., Samsung).
UPDATED Improved performance on Android 7+ when saving photos when using Storage Access Framework
        (no longer need to save to a temporary file to handle Exif tags).
UPDATED When saving "base images" for Noise Reduction mode, keep JPEG quality at 100% even if using
        post processing options.
UPDATED Updated Renderscript to 64-bit code.

FIXED   Problems with toasts being displayed for seekbars on Android 9.
FIXED   Face detection stopped working when recording video (on old Camera API).

FIXED   Problem with Camera2 API where with manual exposure time, preview would display a maximum
        exposure time of 1/12s rather than what the manual exposure time had been set to.
FIXED   When using "red eye" flash, on-screen flash icon (with Camera2 API) was being shown all the
        time, when this actually behaves similar to flash auto.
FIXED   Avoid "capturing" text from being covered by focus bracketing sliders in focus bracketing
        photo mode and landscape orientation.
FIXED   Don't allow continuous fast burst mode (when holding down shutter button) in standard photo
        mode with RAW only (previously this appeared to work, but no images were saved).

        (requires Android 7).
ADDED   On-screen icons for DRO and Expo Bracketing modes.
ADDED   On-screen icon for when audio is disabled in video mode.
UPDATED Now targetting Android 8.1.

        than shaded background).
UPDATED Improved layout of on-screen information.
UPDATED Improved look of popup menu.
UPDATED Improved support for setting frame rates (including high speed support) when using Camera2
        API. Thanks to George Joseph.

UPDATED Don't request audio permission (or show toast if not available) if record audio option for
        video is disabled.
UPDATED Zoom now resets when pausing the application, switching camera, or switching between photo
        and video modes (not resetting zoom tends to confuse users; this change also makes behaviour
        consistent with other camera applications).
UPDATED For "Pause after taking photo" option, pressing Back when preview is paused now unpauses the
        preview and keeps the photo, rather than exiting the application.
UPDATED Don't block UI when image saving queue is full, instead simply don't allow more photos to be
        taken until queue is no longer full. Size of image saving queue is also increased, depending
        on memory of device.
UPDATED Datestamp format (for "Stamp photos" option) yyyy/mm/dd replaced with yyyy-mm-dd (to match
        ISO 8601 standard).
UPDATED Camera2 API now sets CONTROL_ENABLE_ZSL for standard and DRO photo modes on Android 8+.

Version 1.42.1 (2017/12/10)

FIXED   Crash related to front camera fake flash on devices with auto focus and Camera2 API.
FIXED   Possible fix for boot loop on LineageOS (this is a LineageOS bug exposed by using Android
        Studio 3; workaround is to upgrade to build tools 27.0.1).
FIXED   Change in 1.42 for using suffix "_0" etc instead of "_EXP0" etc was only done for HDR expo
        images; now done for Expo {} photo mode too.
FIXED   Text style "Plain text" for "Stamp photos" was still showing a shadow effect.
FIXED   Workaround for Google bug where crash can be reported if application is open when it's being

UPDATED Expo images (either in "Expo {}" photo mode, or HDR when "Save all images for HDR mode" is
        selected) are now saved with suffix "_0" etc, instead of "_EXP0" etc. This means Google
        Photos knows to group the images together.
UPDATED Performance improvements.
UPDATED "Show angle" no longer enabled by default.

Version 1.41.1 (2017/10/21)

FIXED   Crash in 1.41 when opening popup menu in video mode on devices without flash.
FIXED   Crash in 1.41 related to taking photos on burst mode with no delay when camera closing.

UPDATED Changing ISO values is faster (except for switching between auto and manual mode on Camera2
        API).
UPDATED Improved performance by closing camera on background thread when application pauses.
UPDATED HDR improvements (ghost removal, and brightening of too dark images).
UPDATED Expo bracketing and HDR photo modes now have maximum exposure time of 0.5s (for Camera2
        API).

UPDATED Updated Italian translation (thanks to Stefano Gualmo).

Version 1.40 (2017/08/18)

FIXED   Front screen flash wasn't showing if in "everything" immersive mode.
FIXED   Shouldn't show "RAW" on-screen icon when RAW is enabled, but it's not
        supported by the current camera.
FIXED   Fixed title of calibrate level angle dialog (shouldn't be "About").
FIXED   Various crashes.
FIXED   Don't show two toasts when changing scene modes (bug in 1.39).
FIXED   For DRO and HDR modes with Camera2 API, don't set ISO value outside of
        supported range.
ADDED   Polish translation (thanks to Jacek Buczyński).
UPDATED Improvements to HDR algorithm for brightness levels (problems with HDR
        photos coming out too dark).

        haven't been modified.
UPDATED Close camera on background thread.
UPDATED Pause icon now changes when pausing video (thanks to Johan Ejdemark).

UPDATED Don't show ISO info on debug window that's specific to old camera API,
        when using Camera2 API.
UPDATED Performance improvements: reduced memory allocations.
UPDATED Make sure exposure lock icon is set whilst camera is opening.
UPDATED White balances, scene modes, color effects are now shown as "user
        readable" strings (except for old Camera API where there are device
        specific values). This also means these strings can be translated in
        future versions.
UPDATED About debug info now lists information on supported exposure
        compensation and manual ranges.

Version 1.39 (2017/06/28)

        disabled (for Camera2 API).
FIXED   Minor bug in DRO/HDR image generation.
ADDED   Manual white balance temperature (Camera2 API only).
ADDED   HDR and expo bracketing now available for original Camera API (HDR

UPDATED Improved HDR algorithm for areas that are over-exposed even on the
        darkest image.
UPDATED More Exif tags preserved when saving in modes that require re-saving
        the image (e.g., auto-stabilise, photo stamp, DRO, HDR) (requires
        Android 7). Performance also improved for such modes on Android 7.
UPDATED Improved ISO and exposure time scaling for the manual sliders.
UPDATED Don't leave gaps between various on-screen info text (time, free
        memory, etc) if some of them are disabled.
UPDATED Number of exposure bracketing stops now refers to the full half-range.

        OnePlus 3T).
FIXED   Remove duplicate entries from ISO buttons (e.g., for OnePlus 3T).
FIXED   Problems with "fast HDR/expo burst" on Nexus 6 now fixed (you should be
        able to reenable this under "Photo Settings", for faster HDR and expo
        bracketing shots.
FIXED   Shutter sound option wasn't working for Camera2 API unless a photo had
        previously been taken in the same session.
ADDED   Display flash symbol for Camera2 API in flash auto mode, to indicate
        whether flash will fire.
UPDATED Improved battery life when going idle.

        enhancement.
UPDATED Improved performance of on-screen toasts, gives smoother update for
        seekbars (e.g., manual focus, exposure).

Version 1.34 (2016/10/08)

FIXED   Crash on Camera2.
FIXED   Crash for Asus ZenFones with Android 5.0.
FIXED   Face detection and touch to focus not working properly with Camera2 and
        "Rotate preview" option; this should also hopefully fix problems for
        devices with unusual camera orientations (Nexus 5X).
FIXED   Face detection wouldn't switch off with Camera2 API without restart.
FIXED   For file dialog, still allow going up to parent folders even if a
        folder contains no readable files.
FIXED   Pause preview option now shows exactly the saved photo (no lag, and

        Camera2 mode. This offers a possible workaround for devices that have
        poor flash behaviour with Camera2 API.
ADDED   Screen flash to simulate flash auto/on modes for front cameras without
        flash ("auto" requires Camera2).
ADDED   Material design icons for Settings.
UPDATED Now supporting Android 6 permissions. You'll have to "allow"
        permissions for camera and storage for Open Camera to work. Additional
        permissions requested when required are microphone (for video) and
        location (for geotagging).
UPDATED HDR mode now supports flash modes.
UPDATED Extra protection for video recording and running out of storage space -
        if not using Storage Access Framework, and saving to internal memory,
        videos should now stop rather than becoming corrupt when running out of
        storage. Note this can't be supported for Storage Access Framework or
        SD cards due to Android limitations.
UPDATED Stop video when battery level critical, to give extra protection when
        device runs out of video (see
        Settings/Video settings/"Critical battery check" to disable this
        behaviour).
UPDATED Gallery icon now right-most.
UPDATED On-screen icons now have transparent icons.
UPDATED Improved look of popup-menu: headings are larger and in bold.
UPDATED New material design icon for exposure.
UPDATED On-screen ISO (for Camera2 API) displays red when auto-exposure routine
        is scanning.
UPDATED Manual exposure times longer than 1s now shown directly rather than as
        a reciprocal.

FIXED   Problems with Camera2 and flash: no longer does excessive flash; also
        fixed problem where with flash auto, flash would sometimes misfire
        resulting in too dark photos.
FIXED   Problem with Pause Preview option: if a photo with RAW was saved, then
        another photo without RAW saved and deleted, the previous RAW was also
        deleted.
ADDED   New photo mode HDR. Only supported for devices with Camera2 API (and
        Camera2 must be enabled).
ADDED   Support for manual ISO for old camera API on Asus Zenphone 2 Z00A and
        Z008 (thanks to Fl&aacute;vio Keglevich).

ADDED   Slovenian translation (thanks to Peter Klofutar).
UPDATED Folder history (via Gallery long click) now supported when using Storage
        Access Framework.
UPDATED When switching from auto to manual ISO mode in Camera2 API, exposure
        time now defaults to the current (auto) exposure time.

Version 1.32.1 (2016/07/24)

FIXED   Crash on some devices when taking photos with RAW enabled.

Version 1.32 (2016/07/19)

FIXED   Don't repeatedly focus when volume key held down (for "focus" volume
        key option). Hopefully this may help for devices with physical focus
        buttons.
FIXED   Border to indicate photo is being taken no longer remains for "Pause
        after taking photo" option.
FIXED   Now plays sound for start/stop video recording (if shutter sound
        enabled) for Camera2 API.
ADDED   Support for RAW (DNG) files. Only available in Camera2 mode, and if
        your device supports it. Note that most Gallery apps don't recognise
        DNG files, instead use specialised applications like Google Snapseed
        and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, or transfer to a PC.
UPDATED If volume keys are set to "focus", then holding down both volume keys
        will take a photo (this makes your volume keys behave more like a
        physical camera button - hold down one key to focus, then both to take
        a photo).
UPDATED Allow one more photo to be processed in background at a time.
UPDATED Improved timing of shutter sound for Camera2 API.
UPDATED Enabling auto-stabilise now shows an info dialog. Select "Don't show
        again" to prevent the dialog from showing again.

        save folder when using Storage Access Framework (this was aready the
        case when not using Storage Access Framework).
UPDATED 5s and 10s options for maximum video duration.

Version 1.31 (2016/06/19)

FIXED   Crash on Camera2 API (checkArgumentNonnegative).
FIXED   Photo filename's date/time and date/time used for photostamp now match
        better with time the photo was actually taken, rather than when the
        image was saved.
FIXED   Improved Take Photo widget behaviour so it focuses in continuous focus
        mode.
ADDED   New option for filenames to be based on UTC (Zulu) time (thanks to
        David Pletcher).
UPDATED Photos now processed in background thread, for smoother operation (if
        this causes problems, you can disable it under Settings/Photo settings/
        Use background thread).
UPDATED Touching the screen with continuous focus mode in photo mode now causes
        an autofocus.
UPDATED Gallery button shows animation effect to indicate saving images.
UPDATED Photo/video info toast now indicates if auto-stabilise option is on.
UPDATED Don't display pointless toast for front/back camera any more.
UPDATED Updated Russian translation (thanks to Grigorii Chirkov).

        previously set to "loud noise" option.
UPDATED Popup menu now uses the more standard three dots icon.
UPDATED Popup menu also shows indicator for flash being off.
UPDATED Show zoom seekbar closer to the edge of screen if -/+ controls not
        enabled; always show manual focus distance seekbar closer to the edge.

Version 1.29 (2016/05/06)

FIXED   Still show Camera2 API option for Android N's LEVEL_3 hardware level.
FIXED   Problems with flash mode on Camera2 API - now seems to be working
        better on my Nexus 6 at least...
FIXED   Sluggish zooming with Camera2 API.
FIXED   With Camera2 API, if starting up with flash auto or on, and in focus
        modes other than auto, macro or locked, then flash wouldn't fire.
FIXED   Problems on some devices where we claimed failed to take photo, even
        though it had succeed (some Samsung devices call the autofocus callback
        more than once).
FIXED   Video recording icon would get stuck on red ("playing") if failed to
        save video file.
FIXED   Too long string for 3x3 grid for French translation on popup menu.
ADDED   Proper support for continuous focus mode for photo mode.
ADDED   Graphical border effect when taking a photo (if you don't like this,
        you can disable it under Settings/On screen GUI/"Show border when
        taking photo").
ADDED   Animation effect for auto-focus square.
UPDATED Improved on-screen graphics (line drawings now have proper
        density-independent thickness rather than being hairline).
UPDATED On-screen ISO display (for Camera2) simplified and moved to top of
        screen.
UPDATED Use Switches instead of Checkboxes in Settings where appropriate.

        indicate whether it will switch to photo or video mode. Content
        description for "switch camera" button now updates to indicate whether
        it will switch to the front or back camera.
UPDATED Improved content descriptions for buttons on popup menu (focus/flash
        buttons now say which mode they are).
UPDATED Disabled flash options for manual ISO mode in Camera2 API (doesn't work
        properly; plus flash is less useful when setting ISO manually anyway).
UPDATED Switching to ISO auto and back to manual now resets the exposure time
        to default.
UPDATED Debug info now includes device language setting.
UPDATED Default to FullHD rather than higher video resolutions, if possible.

Version 1.28.1 (2016/03/30)

FIXED   Crash when going to "Photo settings" on devices with Czech language
        (bug introduced in 1.28).

Version 1.28 (2016/03/25)

FIXED   Broadcast File-based Uri when using Storage Access Framework, instead
        of SAF Uri (this fixes Owncloud crashing for auto-upload photos/videos
        option; this might also fix problems with photos/videos not showing up
        on SD card until after a reboot?)
FIXED   Unable to get location from network providers on some pre-Android 6
        devices (e.g., Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 7) since v1.27 due to Android OS
        bug, have worked around this.
FIXED   If using Storage Access Framework, and save location was on external SD
        card, the on-screen free memory would show internal storage. (Note that
        with this fix, it may be that the free memory is not shown for external
        SD cards, but that's better than showing an incorrect value.)
FIXED   Toast for hitting max filesize on video recording wasn't shown for very
        long.
FIXED   Was incorrectly showing "n repeats to go" toast even if it wasn't going
        to repeat (e.g., due to user stopping video recording).
FIXED   Use unicode character for degrees symbol (fixes warning in Android
        Studio).
FIXED   Corrected content description of take photo icon for when switched to
        video mode (for accessibility).
FIXED   Don't show thumbnails of earlier photos/videos when device is locked.
FIXED   Fixed various FindBugs errors.
ADDED   New options to take photo/record video by making a noise, or responding
        to the voice command "cheese".
ADDED   Option to control maximum filesize of videos.
ADDED   New option to disable performing auto-focus on startup (disable this if
        you have the bug where flash turns on on startup).
ADDED   Belarusian translation (thanks to Zmicer Turok).
ADDED   Czech translation (thanks to Jaroslav Svoboda).
ADDED   Japanese translation (thanks to Mitsuse).
ADDED   Turkish translation (thanks to Serdar Erkoc).
UPDATED Video now automatically restarts (rather than stopping) if the device's
        maximum filesize (typically ~2GB), or the user specified limit, is hit.
        (Option also added to not restart, if you prefer.)
UPDATED Don't show info toasts so often - only if an unusual non-default
        setting is set, or when switching between photo and video modes.
UPDATED Improved quality of take photo/video icons.

Version 1.27 (2015/10/25)

FIXED   Crash on Android 6 when accessing popup menu.
FIXED   Crashes on Android 6 if users have denied permissions (currently Open
        Camera won't request permissions at runtime, and please don't expect

        fix to prevent crashes).

        created.
FIXED   Toast for changing exposure compensation is no longer on top of the -/+

        and frame rate not as smooth as it could be in good light.

        save folder, rather than the latest image/video on the device. Also

UPDATED Now uses Material Design theme style on Android 5.

        better for not ruining night vision; sorry if you preferred the old
        look, but Android doesn't seem to cope well with mixing themes in the
        same Activity).
UPDATED "Photo and video settings" preference screen now split up into "Photo
        settings", "Video settings" and "Location settings".

        Settings/On screen GUI/Immersive mode. You can set the option to use
        KitKat's immersive mode, either hiding the GUI, or even hiding
        everything except the camera preview. Touch the preview or swipe in
        from side to exit immersive mode. Also added an option to not even dim
        the on-screen virtual navigation buttons.

        enable the new option.
UPDATED Can now choose new save location from recent save folders picker.
UPDATED Improved look of recent save folders picker.
UPDATED Popup menu button now also shows indicator for torch.

        (if you previously had this shortcut on your homescreen, you may need
        to re-add it as a widget).

Version 1.21 (2014/11/15)

FIXED   Broadcasts of Camera.ACTION_NEW_PICTURE, com.android.camera.NEW_PICTURE
        and Camera.ACTION_NEW_VIDEO intents weren't supplying the Uri correctly
        - auto-uploading for photos and videos with Owncloud should now work.
FIXED   Corrected look of popup animation when in left-handed UI mode.

        data is enabled.

        and taking a photo from the lock screen (requires Android 4.2).
UPDATED Popup menu button now shows flash indicator (for flash auto or on).
UPDATED Cleaned up settings - removed some options that are more easily
        selected from the popup menu (ISO, white balance, scene mode, color
        effect, auto-stabilize).

Version 1.20 (2014/09/21)

FIXED   Crash (NumberFormatException in Parameters.getPreviewFpsRange()) on
        startup for mb526.

UPDATED New icon (by Cosmin Saveanu).

Version 1.19 (2014/09/08)

FIXED   Crashes on startup due to invalid parameters being set.

FIXED   Problem on some devices (e.g., Galaxy S5) if in video mode, and focus
        mode is not continuous, and user went to settings and back, then tried
        to record - video would hang.
ADDED   Spanish translation (thanks to Mario Sanoguera).
UPDATED If camera can't be opened, touching the screen now tries to reopen the
        camera.
UPDATED Allow installation of app onto external storage.

FIXED   Crash if failed to start camera preview.
FIXED   Crash when changing flash mode, if camera was lost.
FIXED   Problem where photos were being taken out of focus on some devices (bug
        introduced in v1.16).
FIXED   "Save location" option didn't work if folder didn't exist (this also
        meant it didn't work when the app is first installed, unless a
        photo/video was taken first) (bug introduced in v1.16 with the new file
        chooser dialog).
ADDED   New options for volume keys: focus, and switch auto-stabilise on/off.
UPDATED Allow changing flash mode while recording video (so torch can be
        switched on and off).

        whilst focusing.
FIXED   Changing left/right handedness of UI didn't update until app
        paused/resumed.
FIXED   Problems with left-handed UI when going to settings and back, icons
        would shift to incorrect positions.
FIXED   When geotagging was enabled, this didn't take effect until the app was
        paused and resumed (or restarted).
FIXED   If zoomed in, then switch camera or app paused, the camera preview
        would reset to being unzoomed on some devices (e.g., Nexus 7).

        type the path.

FIXED   Crash when exiting settings, if camera wasn't opened (bug introduced in
        v1.14).
FIXED   More crashes due to camera drivers that aren't following Android API
        specs (Parameters.getFocusMode() should always be non-null, but isn't
        on some devices!)
FIXED   If video failed due to error (e.g., hitting device max filesize,
        running out of space, of other errors), Open Camera now stops properly
        rather than thinking the video is still recording. Last video error is
        also stored in the about/debug window.
ADDED   New option to lock orientation to portrait or landscape.
ADDED   New option Flash while recording video.
UPDATED Touch to set focus/metering now works while recording video.

        couldn't be opened.
FIXED   Problem with face detection not resuming after focusing on mtk6589.

        Problem that this caused with aspect ratio with video recording.
FIXED   Open Camera now available as a choice when camera icon pressed from
        Gallery app (Open Camera now responds to
        android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA).
FIXED   Open Camera now available as a choice when camera icon pressed from
        Cover Lock Screen (beta) app (Open Camera now responds to
        android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA_SECURE).
FIXED   All available video resolutions are now supported.
ADDED   New "manual" focus mode - focusing happens when you touch the screen,
        but it doesn't do automatic focusing when taking a photo.
ADDED   Support for more hardware buttons: camera button to take photo/video;
        focus button; zoom in/out buttons.
ADDED   Long press on gallery icon now shows a popup of recent save folders (if
        more than one is available), allowing you to quickly change between
        them.
ADDED   Location data now stored in videos too, if geotagging option is enabled
        (only for MPEG4 and 3GPP video formats).
ADDED   Option for volume keys to do nothing (not even changing the device
        volume).

        specified time); also option to restart video a specified number of
        times.
UPDATED Significantly improved speed for opening and closing settings (now
        launched as a Fragment rather than a separate Activity).
UPDATED Open Camera now remains active rather than being blocked by a "screen
        lock" (face/PIN unlock still required to go to Gallery or Settings).
        This behaviour can be switched off by going to Settings/More Camera
        Controls/Show camera when locked.
UPDATED Broadcast Camera.ACTION_NEW_PICTURE and com.android.camera.NEW_PICTURE
        intents for new photos, and Camera.ACTION_NEW_VIDEO for new videos.
UPDATED WYSIWYG mode is now the default setting for the preview size.
UPDATED Expanded number of devices which show the "Force 4K UHD video
        (experimental)" option (remember, 4K isn't officially supported by
        Android API and this option is experimental - if this option shows, it
        doesn't necessarily mean it will work on your device).
UPDATED Video time is now shown with smaller font and off-centre, so as to not
        obscure the view so much.

Version 1.13 (2014/05/24)

FIXED   Crash when opening settings on devices that didn't support
        auto-stabilise (bug introduced in v1.10).
FIXED   Crash introduced in v1.10 to do with cancelling autofocus on some
        devices.
ADDED   Options for video bitrate and frame rate. Note that both of these are
        approximate settings, and whether they can be achieved may depend on
        your device, and other conditions such as lighting. Also note that
        setting non-default values for bitrate of frame rate may cause video
        recording to fail, if the values are not supported.
UPDATED About window now shows device manufacturer and model, to help with
        debugging.

Version 1.12 (2014/05/19)

        some Galaxy S5 variants).

Version 1.11 (2014/05/17)

        mode (fixes some problems on some devices).

FIXED   Preview wouldn't restart after taking photo with continuous focus, on
        Galaxy Nexus.
FIXED   Problems with aspect ratio when not using WYSIWYG preview mode and
        recording video.
FIXED   Camcorder profile was always being initialised from the back camera,
        even when recording video with the front camera.
ADDED   New (experimental!) option to support 4K UHD (3840x2160) video
        (Settings->Photo and video settings->Force 4K UHD video). Note that 4K
        video isn't properly supported by Android API, so this option may show
        even if it isn't supported on your device, and may not work or even
        crash. I've successfully tested this on a Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 3.
ADDED   Option to not display the -/+ zoom control.
UPDATED All available video resolutions offered by the camera are now supported.
UPDATED Picture and video resolution preferences display aspect ratio and
        megapixels of each resolution.

        introduced in v1.8).

ADDED   Option to not force screen display to maximum brightness.

ADDED   Support for hardware menu button (now opens settings).
ADDED   Option to display a 4x2 grid (if you previously had a 3x3 "rule of
        thirds" grid, you'll have to reenable it under the Settings).
ADDED   Added privacy policy (for location permission/geotagging) to intro
        window text (needed for Nokia Store).
ADDED   Uses setRecordingHint, may improve performance of starting video
        recording.
ADDED   New About option in Settings, providing debug info.
UPDATED Don't re-autofocus before taking a photo, if camera recently
        successfully focused due to user touching the screen.
UPDATED Display yellow or green dot next to earth icon to indicate location
        accuracy.
UPDATED Display earth icon with red dash through it, if geotagging is enabled,
        but the app doesn't have a location.

UPDATED Offset zoom slider slightly so as to not interfere with Google Now
        swipe.
UPDATED Allow greater range of characters (including unicode) for save location
        (now allows any character other than those reserved by filesystem).

Version 1.7 (2014/01/29)

FIXED   More fixes for aspect ratio - the preview display should now always
        have a 1:1 aspect ratio (on some devices this may mean black bars are
        shown, if there isn't a match between the camera's available preview
        sizes, and the aspect ratio of the device's display).
FIXED   Possible crash relating to creating thumbnails.
FIXED   Autofocus on startup didn't always actually focus.
FIXED   If camera doesn't support focus areas, but does support metering areas,
        still set the metering area.
FIXED   Was sometimes trying to set metering areas when metering areas not
        supported by device.
FIXED   If image is deleted after taking the photo, the thumbnail is now
        properly updated to what is now the most recent photo or video.
ADDED   New option to set preview aspect ratio to match the picture/video
        aspect ratio (WYSIWIG).
UPDATED Save folder can now be an absolute path, allowing possibility to save
        on external SD cards (though you need to know what the path is, which
        typically varies depending on device; I am unable to test this, so
        please let me know if it does or doesn't work).
UPDATED Zoom -/+ control now matches the zoom slider orientation.
UPDATED Hide some icons when taking video, as they don't do anything.

Version 1.6 (2014/01/20)

FIXED   Crash when trying to access image or video resolutions in settings, if
        camera didn't offer these settings.
FIXED   Exposure compensation wasn't available on devices if min or max
        exposure compensation level was equal to 0.
FIXED   Aspect ratio problems with the preview on some devices (if you are
        still having problems, please let me know what Android device you are
        using).
FIXED   Aspect ratio problems with the preview on all devices when switching
        the camera.
FIXED   Problem on smaller devices where on-screen text overlapped with take
        photo button; the text is now aligned to above the button on all
        devices.
ADDED   Zoom can now be also controlled via on-screen slider (next to the
        plus/minus zoom buttons).
ADDED   Option for volume keys to control the exposure compensation.
ADDED   Option to display compass direction of camera on-screen (defaults to
        on, disable it in options if you don't like it).
ADDED   Option to choose microphone for recording audio (support for external
        microphones).
UPDATED Exposure compensation is now set via a new button in the on-screen GUI
        (the black and white +/- symbol) instead of the settings. Clicking this
        will bring up a slider and plus/minus buttons to adjust the exposure
        compensation. To get rid of the slider and buttons, either click the
        Exposure button again, or click elsewhere on the screen.
UPDATED Geotagging now stores image compass direction (GPSImgDirection,
        GPSImgDirectionRef).
UPDATED Display degree symbol for displayed on-screen angles.
UPDATED Zoom control is now transparent.
UPDATED Filter applied to sensor for device angle.

Version 1.5 (2014/01/09)

FIXED   Crash on Android 4.4 when launching for first time, or changing the
        save folder (issue with creating the save folder, due to Android no
        longer allowing ANDROID_MEDIA_MOUNTED to be broadcast).
FIXED   Crash if failed to open camera after switching cameras, then user tried
        to zoom.
FIXED   Other potential crashes (NumberFormatException on "es209ra" on startup;
        RuntimeException on Xperia Go when taking photo; RuntimeException on
        "maxx_ax5" when taking photo with face detection).

Version 1.4 (2013/12/16)

FIXED   Calculation for focus areas wasn't right for front facing cameras.
FIXED   Exif data wasn't getting saved if auto-stabilise option was enabled
        (this also meant that on some cameras/focus modes, the orientation
        would have been incorrect).
FIXED   "Toast" pop-up messages looked poor on Android 4.4.
FIXED   Fixed potential crash if taking picture fails.
FIXED   Touch to focus with continuous focus shouldn't show red box.
FIXED   Crash with auto-stabilise for some angles larger than 90 degrees.
FIXED   Crash when rotating device when viewing "Photo and video settings".
FIXED   If device was rotated when app was idle, the UI sometimes showed with
        the incorrect orientation.
ADDED   Images now tagged with current location (optional, off by default). Note
        that Open Camera now requires Location permission, for this feature.
ADDED   Option for face detection.
ADDED   Touch to select focus area also now sets the metering area (used to
        determine exposure).
ADDED   Now displays current time.
ADDED   Option to display a 3x3 grid ("rule of thirds").
ADDED   Now displays flashy thumbnail animation when taking a photo (you can
        disable this in the options under "More camera controls..." if you
        don't like this sort of thing!)
UPDATED Gallery button now displays thumbnail of last image/video taken.
UPDATED Clicking the Gallery button now goes to most recent image/video.
UPDATED Made it easier to see on-screen text when underlying photo preview is
        bright, by drawing a background with the text.

FIXED   Video files may not have shown up properly in other apps, or over USB,
        until rebooting device.
FIXED   Make sure filenames for images/videos are unique.
ADDED   New burst mode option - take a repeated set of photos at once, or with
        a delay.
ADDED   Option for video resolution.
ADDED   Display battery status on screen.
UPDATED Reorganised settings screen to remove clutter - less commonly used
        options have been moved to sub-screens; "Record audio?" is moved to
        "Photo and video settings..."
UPDATED Only show zoom level (if that option is set) when actually zoomed in.

Version 1.2 (2013/11/09)

FIXED   Crash when launching gallery, if no Gallery app installed on device.

FIXED   Focus area wasn't getting reset when it should (e.g., changing focus
        mode or zooming).
FIXED   Fixed potential crash on auto focus.

        by changing options, e.g., changing focus mode).
