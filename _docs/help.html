<p><a name="quickstart"><b>Quickstart</b></a></p>

<p>Simply point, and press the blue camera icon <img src="take_photo.png" alt="Take Photo icon" width="32" height="32"> to take a photo.
If your device supports focus areas, you can touch the part of the screen you want to focus. Touching an area will also
(if your device supports it) control the exposure level (e.g., so clicking on a bright area will adjust the exposure
so that it becomes less bright). To zoom, use the slider next to the take photo button, or do a multi-touch "pinch"
gesture. You can also control via the volume keys on your phone or tablet - by default, pressing them will take a
photo, but you can change this to zoom in/out from the <a href="#settings">Settings</a>.</p>

<p>You can press the gallery icon to view your photos
(by default saved in the OpenCamera folder) - it will show the most recent image or video. The gallery button's
icon will also show a thumbnail for the most recent image/video.</p>

<p>The screen display is kept on when Open Camera is running as the foreground app (if
you want to switch off the display, do so on your device manually).</p>

<p><a name="user_interface"><b>On-Screen User Interface</b></a></p>

<p><img src="take_photo.png" alt="Take Photo icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Take photo</b> - Click to take
a photo. In some cases, you can also hold (long press) for a continuous burst:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Photo mode must be Standard or Fast Burst</li>
    <li>Settings/"Camera API" must be set to "Camera2 API".</li>
    <li>Continuous burst only supported on some devices and resolutions.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="take_video.png" alt="Switch to video icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch to video mode</b> - Clicking the
    smaller video icon will switch to video mode. The photo and video icons will then swap: click the larger video icon to
    start/stop video recording, and click the smaller photo icon to switch back to photo mode.</p>

<p><img src="switch_camera.png" alt="Switch Camera icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch camera</b> - Switches between front and back camera (if your
device has both front and back cameras). If your device has more than one front and/or back camera, then this will switch
between the first front and back camera.</p>

<p><img src="baseline_add_a_photo_white_48.png" alt="Switch multi-camera icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch multi-camera icon</b> -
    This icon only shows on devices with more than one front and/or back cameras, and allows you to switch between those
    cameras. For example, a device might have two back cameras, one standard and one ultra-wide, this icon will switch between
    the standard and ultra-wide camera.
    If Settings/On screen GUI/"Multiple cameras icon" is disabled, then this icon will not show; instead the "Switch camera"
    icon can by used to cycle through all the cameras.
    Note that some devices do not allow third party applications to access their multiple cameras, in which case Open Camera isn't
    able to use them.</p>

<p><img src="exposure_unlocked.png" alt="Lock Exposure icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Exposure lock</b> - Click to lock or unlock the exposure.
When locked, the icon will change to <img src="exposure_locked.png" alt="Exposure Locked icon" width="32" height="32">. Locking the exposure means
the exposure doesn't change based on the brightness of the current scene (though you can still adjust the exposure
compensation). Note that this isn't guaranteed to work on all devices (doesn't seem to work on Galaxy S3, Nexus 6).</p>

<p><img src="ic_exposure_white_48dp.png" alt="Exposure Compensation icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Exposure compensation, ISO and Manual White Balance</b> - Clicking this will bring
a panel with various controls:</p><ul>
    <li>
        <b>ISO (top row)</b> - (Not supported on all devices.) A higher ISO setting means the camera is more sensitive to light, though may
        also result in more noise. This mimics the film speed on traditional film cameras. Select "AUTO" to switch back to
        automatic ISO mode. See
        <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings">here</a> for more details on ISO.
        If Camera2 API is used, then selecting a non-auto ISO will bring up sliders allowing direct control over the ISO and exposure
        time (in place of the exposure compensation slider). You can also select "M" to switch straight to manual mode, keeping to the
        current ISO value.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Exposure compensation (slider)</b> - A higher value increases the exposure, so that pictures come out brighter in low light; a
        lower value makes pictures darker. One unit of EV changes the brightness of the captured image by a factor of two. +1 EV
        doubles the image brightness, while -1 EV halves the image brightness. Set to 0 for the default exposure.
        See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_compensation">Exposure compensation</a>.
        (Only available if the camera supports control of the exposure.)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>ISO and shutter speed sliders</b> -  If Camera2 API is used, and a non-auto ISO mode is selected, instead of the exposure
        compensation sliders, two sliders will appear allowing you to control the ISO more finely, and (if supported) the exposure
        (shutter speed) time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Manual white balance</b> - If Camera2 API is used, and manual white balance is enabled (from the popup menu), then this
        will also show a slider allowing you to control the white balance temperature.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>To get rid of this panel, either click the Exposure button again, or click elsewhere on the screen.</p>

<p><img src="popup.png" alt="Popup icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Popup menu</b> - Opens the popup menu for quick access to changing
various options:</p><ul>
<li><b>Flash</b> - Typical options are off, auto, on and torch mode. For front cameras without a real flash, flash and torch options
will be available which instead work by making the screen light up (note, front screen flash "auto" is only available with Camera2 API).</li>
<li><b>Focus</b> - Controls the focusing method used. Available options depend on your device. These may include:<ul>
    <li><img src="focus_mode_continuous_picture.png" alt="Continuous focus icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Continuous (default)</b> -
        The camera focuses continuously. This is generally the best mode - the preview will usually always be in focus, and taking photos
        is quick when the preview is already in focus. Note that you can still manually focus by touching the screen.
    </li>
    <li><img src="focus_mode_auto.png" alt="Auto focus icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Auto</b> -
        The camera focuses when you take a photo, or when you touch to focus.
    </li>
    <li><img src="focus_mode_infinity.png" alt="Infinity focus icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Infinity</b> -
        The camera focus will be fixed for objects far away.
    </li>
    <li><img src="baseline_filter_vintage_white_48.png" alt="Macro focus icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Macro</b> -
        This behaves similarly to auto focus, but is optimised for close-up objects.
    </li>
    <li><img src="focus_mode_locked.png" alt="Locked focus icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Locked</b> -
        The camera does not focus, unless you manually touch to focus.
    </li>
    <li><img src="focus_mode_manual.png" alt="Manual focus icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Manual</b> -
        A slider appears allowing you to manually control the focus distance (only available if Camera2
        API is used).
    </li>
    <li><img src="focus_mode_fixed.png" alt="Fixed focus icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Fixed</b> -
        The focus remains fixed.
    </li>
    <li><img src="focus_mode_edof.png" alt="Fixed focus icon" width="32" height="32"><b>EDOF</b> -
        Extended depth of field (EDOF). Focusing is done digitally and continuously.
    </li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Photo Mode</b> - You can also choose different photo modes:<ul>
    <li><b>STD</b> - Standard operation: takes a single photo.</li>
    <li><b>NR</b> - Enables <a href="#noise_reduction">Noise Reduction</a> mode. (Only available on some devices,
    and if Camera2 API is used.)</li>
    <li><b>DRO</b> - Enables <a href="#dro">Dynamic Range Optimisation</a> mode (requires Android 5).</li>
    <li><b>HDR</b> - Enables <a href="#hdr">High Dynamic Range</a> mode (requires Android 5).</li>
    <li><b>Pano</b> - Enables <a href="#pano">Panorama</a> mode (requires Android 5).</li>
    <li><b>[]]]</b> - Enables Fast Burst mode. Takes multiple images in quick succession. (Only available on some
    devices, and if Camera2 API is used.) In this mode, you can change the number of photos to take from the
    popup menu.</li>
    <li><b>Expo {}</b> - Enables Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) mode. Takes multiple images at different exposure
    levels. See Settings/"Photo settings" for options to control the number of images and stops. These images can
    be processed in other applications to create HDR images. For Android, you can try my own
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.opencamera.vibrancehdr">Vibrance HDR</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Focus {}</b> - Enables <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracketing#Focus_bracketing">Focus Bracketing</a>
    mode. (Only available on some devices, and if Camera2 API is
    used.) This mode takes a series of photos each with a different focus distance. Two sliders appear, allowing you
    to change the "source" and "target" focus distance. In this mode, you can change the number of photos to take from
    the popup menu. Also on the popup menu, the option "Add infinite distance" if enabled will mean an extra photo is
    taken, at infinite focus distance. Focus bracketing is typically used with
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_stacking">Focus stacking</a> software to merge the images into a single
    photo. Note that whilst taking a set of focus bracketed photos, you can cancel the set by pressing the "take photo"
    button again.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Auto-level</b> - Enable the auto-level feature for photos (see
<a href="#auto_stabilise">below</a>). (Only available if the device has enough memory.)</li>
<li><b>Aperture</b> - Allows changing the current camera aperture. Large numbers mean smaller aperture, which means less
    light is allowed into the camera. (Only available on some devices, and if Camera2 API is used.)</li>
<li><b>Camera resolution</b> - Change the photo resolution (also available under Settings/Photo
Settings/"Camera resolution".</li>
<li><b>Video resolution</b> - Change the photo resolution (also available under Settings/Video
Settings/"Video resolution".</li>
<li><b>Speed</b> - This allows you to record video at either a faster rate (time lapse) or slower
    rate (slow motion). Note that slow motion is only available on some devices, and requires
    Camera2 API to be enabled. Also note that sound is not recorded in time lapse or slow motion
    modes.</li>
<li><b>Timer</b> - Set a timer for taking photos or recording video. Also available under
Settings/Timer.</li>
<li><b>Repeat</b> - Take a repeated set of photos when the take photo button is pressed. The time
interval between each repeated photo can be set under Settings/"Repeat mode interval".</li>
<li><b>Grid</b> - Whether to display one of a choice of grids on the camera preview. Also available
under Settings/Camera preview/"Show a grid".</li>
<li><b>White balance</b> - Choose a method to control how the white balance is set. See
<a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance">here</a> for an
explanation of white balance. (Only available if the camera supports different white balance
settings.) If Camera2 API is enabled, then you can also set "manual". In this mode, manual
control over the white balance temperature is available from the exposure compensation icon
<img src="ic_exposure_white_48dp.png" alt="Exposure Compensation icon" width="32" height="32">.</li>
<li><b>Scene mode</b> - Choose a scene mode to apply. (Only available if the camera supports scene
modes.)</li>
<li><b>Color effect</b> - Choose a color effect to apply. (Only available if the camera supports
color effects.)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="settings.png" alt="Settings icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Settings</b> - Click to open the <a href="#settings">Settings</a>. (If your phone/tablet
has a hardware menu button, pressing that should also open the settings.)</p>

<p><b>Gallery</b> - Click to launch the Gallery app, to view the most recent
photo/video (by default saved in the OpenCamera folder). If you get the message "No Gallery app available", then you should install
a Gallery app.
You can also "long press" on the Gallery icon - this will let you switch between the recent save locations, or take you straight to a
file dialog to choose a save location if additional locations have yet been defined. See
<a href="#save_location">Save location</a> under Settings/More camera controls for more details.</p>

<p><b><img src="ic_pause_circle_outline_white_48dp.png" alt="Pause video icon" width="32" height="32">Pause video</b> - When recording
video, this icon allows you to pause and then resume video recording. (Requires Android 7.0 or higher.)</p>

<p><b><img src="take_photo_when_video_recording.png" alt="Take photo snapshot icon" width="32" height="32">Take photo snapshot</b> - When recording
video, the switch to photo mode icon turns white - selecting it will now take a photo while recording video. Note that different
    photo modes are not supported when taking photos while recording video, nor is RAW supported. The photo resolution will not
    in general match the resolution set in preferences, rather it will be set automatically (usually to match the aspect ratio
    of the video resolution).</p>

<p>In continuous focus mode, a white circle shows to indicate that the camera is focusing. When touching to focus, or in
    autofocus mode, a white square is shown (depending on the focus mode), which turns green to indicate that the auto-focus was
    successful, or red if it was not.</p>

<p>The on-screen display also shows the remaining battery left (green/red status bar in the corner), and optionally
the zoom level (if zoomed in), the remaining free storage space on the device, and the current angle orientation
of the camera. If "Store location data" is enabled (off by default), then a small GPS icon
<img src="ic_gps_fixed_white_48dp.png" alt="Location/GPS icon" width="24" height="24"> will appear at the top left
when the location is available (you can still take photos when the GPS icon doesn't show,
it's just that location data won't be stored in the photo). A dot shows to the top-right of the GPS icon to
indicate the accuracy (green for accurate, yellow for less accurate, grey if waiting for location but using a recently
cached location). If the location isn't available, a dash will be shown through the gps icon.</p>

<p><a name="auto_stabilise"><b>Auto-level feature</b></a></p>

<p>All mobile phone cameras will rotate the photo depending on the orientation of the camera, but only to the nearest 90 degrees - so the
photos look right whether you hold the device in "portrait" or "landscape" mode. But Open Camera has the option to rotate the
photos so they are perfectly level, so your shots come out looking perfectly level every time!</p>

<p><a href="auto_level_v_1_48_web.jpg">
<img src="auto_level_v_1_48_web.jpg" style="max-width:100%" alt="Screenshots demonstrating auto-level" title="Screenshots demonstrating auto-level">
</a></p>

<p>The above shows a rather exaggerated example - in practice, you can probably take better photos, but this feature ensures they
come out perfectly level, without you having to edit them afterwards in a photo editor. Of course you won't always want this -
perhaps you're going for artistic 45-degree shots - so this is an option. By default it is disabled.  To enable, open the
<a href="#user_interface">Popup menu</a>, and enable "Auto-level". Note that this feature is memory intensive - it will not be available
on devices with low memory. Even where it is available, the performance of taking photos will be
slower.</p>

<p>Also note that the feature reduces the available space in the image - because rotating an image
    makes it no longer fit into a rectangular image, so we have to crop it. So it's still advisable
    to try to hold the camera reasonably level when using this feature.
    When auto-level is enabled, an on-screen rectangle will display the frame of the resultant
    rotated photo (note that this won't necessarily be 100% accurate depending on device/resolution,
    in the same way that normally the preview frame may not perfectly match the resultant photo -
    this will especially be true if Settings/Camera preview/"Preview size" is set to
    "Maximise preview size".</p>

<p>Note that auto-stabilising will not occur if the device is pointing up or down.</p>

<p><a name="noise_reduction"><b>Noise Reduction</b></a></p>

<p>In Noise Reduction photo mode, Open Camera takes a burst of photos which are then automatically merged, to improve photo quality.
This is particularly useful in low light scenes to reduce noise.
<!--The image below shows an example with one of the input burst photos on the left, and the resultant merged photo on the right:-->
</p>

<p>Some things to note about Open Camera's NR feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>In dark scenes, NR will also apply pixel binning, merging 4 pixels into 1 to reduce noise. Therefore in such cases , the
resultant photo resolution will be halved in width and height.</li>
<li>In bright scenes where there is a high dynamic range, NR mode will perform better than Standard at capturing the dynamic range.
This is similar to what Open Camera's <a href="#hdr">HDR</a> mode can achieve. Also see <a href="#nr_vs_hdr">NR vs HDR</a>.</li>
<li>Taking photos with NR is significantly slower than regular photos.</li>
<li>Although Open Camera applies auto-alignment to the images, it's still best to try to hold your device steady while the photo is
being taken. Aside from reducing the risk of ghosting effects, the more steady the camera is, the more effective the noise reduction
algorithm is in reducing noise and enhancing detail.</li>
<li>If you have a Google Pixel with Pixel Visual Core, you should get Google's HDR+ photos when using Open Camera's Standard photo mode, so there
is generally little benefit to using Open Camera's NR mode on these devices. See "Does Open Camera support HDR+" in the
<a href="#faq">FAQ</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Noise Reduction photo mode, an additional "NR mode" option will appear on the popup mode. This defaults to Normal, but
you can change to "Low Light" mode, which further improves results in dark scenes. If Open Camera detects poor light in this
mode, it will take a burst of images for a duration of around 5 seconds. For best results, use a tripod, or try to hold the
camera as steady as possible.</p>

<p>See my <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/blog/2018/09/noise-reduction-photo-mode/">blog post</a> for more details.</p>

<p><a name="dro"><b>DRO</b></a></p>

<p>Dynamic Range Optimisation (DRO) is a technique that optimises the dynamic range available in the image. In particular, dark
regions will have their brightness boosted to bring out the detail. This mode is useful for capturing scenes with a wide range
of brightness (e.g., on a bright sunny day) as well as being useful to automatically optimise photos in low light scenes. Also
see <a href="#dro_vs_hdr">DRO vs HDR</a>.</p>

<p>Note that if Camera2 API is used, DRO will give improved quality in bright scenes.</p>

<p><a name="hdr"><b>HDR</b></a></p>

<p>High Dynamic Range Imaging (HDR) is a technique where the camera takes multiple shots at different exposures, and combines them
into a single image. A typical problem in photography is that a scene may contain a brightness range that is wider than what can be
captured in a single shot. Varying the exposure (whether by touching on the screen, or exposure compentation or manual exposure) might
make darker regions brighter, but leave other areas over-exposured. Or reducing the exposure to prevent over-exposure may result in
the rest of the scene being too dark. HDR uses an algorithm to combine the best parts of each image, and adjusts the colors so that
the full range of brightness values are captured in the scene:</p>

<p><a href="hdr_20160901_194227.jpg">
<img src="hdr_20160901_194227_thumb.jpg" style="max-width:100%" alt="Images demonstrating HDR" title="Images demonstrating HDR">
</a></p>

<p>The left set of three images show the individual exposures, the right the final HDR image.</p>

<p>Some things to note about Open Camera's HDR feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking photos with HDR is significantly slower than regular photos (although note that HDR will give much faster performance if Camera2 API is enabled, see Settings - not all devices support this).</li>
<li>HDR isn't so good for scenes with movement, due to combining an image from multiple shots. Open Camera does apply "deghosting"
to reduce the problem, but this isn't perfect.</li>
<li>Although Open Camera applies auto-alignment to the images, it's still best to try to hold your device steady while the photo is
being taken.</li>
<li>HDR can sometimes result in less accurate color reproduction (due to trying to estimate the colors from multiple exposures).</li>
<li>Some camera apps use "HDR" to mean "apply a whacky-looking filter". Whilst HDR filters can be used to apply a rather
unreal or vivid image, for now Open Camera's HDR is more geared towards capturing the range of exposures. Also note that many camera
apps that advertise "HDR" don't even make use of multiple images - this is more a case of filtering, than HDR.</li>
<li>If you have a Google Pixel with Pixel Visual Core, you should get Google's HDR+ photos when using Open Camera's Standard photo mode, so there
is generally little benefit to using Open Camera's HDR mode on these devices. See "Does Open Camera support HDR+" in the
<a href="#faq">FAQ</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="dro_vs_hdr"><b>DRO vs HDR</b></a></p>

<p>Both DRO and HDR share in common that they are ways to handle wide ranges of brightness. They each have their pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>DRO requires only a single image from the sensor, so shots are fast to take, and fine for scenes with movement, unlike HDR.</li>
<li>Photos will still take longer to process compared with Standard photo mode, but it will still be faster than HDR.</li>
<li>HDR will in general be better at scenes with a high range of brightness values. It can take advantage of the information from
three separate images, rather than reprocessing a single image.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="nr_vs_hdr"><b>NR vs HDR</b></a></p>

<p>In scenes with high dynamic range, HDR should do better at capturing the high dynamic range (although NR should still be better
than Standard photo mode). Though NR still has the advantage that it is less prone to ghosting and misalignment. NR is also better
suited to working in a wide range of scenes.</p>

<p>The set of images below shows: Standard photo on the left, Noise Reduction in the middle, HDR on the right. There is less overexposure
in the sky in the Noise Reduction result, but the HDR mode does even better.</p>

<p><a href="avg_image_test45.jpg">
<img src="avg_image_test45_thumb.jpg" style="max-width:100%" alt="Screenshots demonstrating Noise Reduction vs HDR" title="Screenshots demonstrating Noise Reduction vs HDR">
</a></p>

<p>In summary: NR is better if you just want a "works best in most cases" option. HDR may be a better choice specifically in
scenes with high dynamic range, that also don't have movement in the scene.</p>

<p><a name="pano"><b>Panorama</b></a></p>

<p>Panorama photo mode allows creating wide photos, by stitching together multiple separate photos.</p>

<p>To take a panorama image, hold your device in portrait orientation, and click to take a photo to start the panorama. Two blue circular dots
will then appear. Rotate your device about the device's axis, either to the left or right, to move the centred white circle over one of the
blue dots, which will allow the camera to capture another image. After each new image is captured, keep rotating your device to cover each new
blue dot that appears in turn. If the device is tilted to one side too much, an icon will appear to indicate you need to rotate the device
clockwise or anti-clockwise.</p>

<p>Click the tick icon to save the panorama, or the cross icon to cancel. Or the panorama will automatically save after 10 images have been
captured.</p>

<p>For best results, try to keep your device steady, apart from rotating about the device's axis. Note that panorama photos can take time to process and save.</p>

<p>Note that the following options are not supported with panorama:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timer.</li>
<li>Auto-repeat.</li>
<li>Immersive mode.</li>
<li>Pause after taking photo.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="settings"><b>Settings</b></a></p>

<!--<p><b>Camera Effects:</b></p>-->

<!--<p><b>Apply a color effect</b> - Choose a color effect to apply. (Only available if the camera supports color effects.)</p>

<p><b>Apply a scene mode</b> - Choose a scene mode to apply. (Only available if the camera supports scene modes.)</p>

<p><b>Set the white balance</b> - Choose a method to control how the white balance is set. See
<a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance">here</a> for an explanation of white balance. (Only
available if the camera supports different white balance settings.)</p>-->

<!--<p><b>Set the exposure compensation</b> - A higher value increases the exposure,
so that pictures come out brighter in low light; a lower value makes pictures
darker. Set to 0 for the default exposure. See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_compensation">Exposure compensation</a>.
(Only available if the camera supports control of the exposure.)</p>-->

<!--<p><b>Set the ISO</b> - A higher ISO setting means the camera is more sensitive to light, though may also result in more
noise. This mimics the film speed on traditional film cameras. Note that this setting may not be supported on all cameras.
See <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings">here</a> for more details on ISO.</p>

<p><b>Auto-level</b> - Enable the auto-level features for photos (see <a href="#auto_stabilise">above</a>). (Only available
if the device has enough memory.)</p>-->

<p><b>Camera Controls:</b></p>

<p><a name="face_detection"><b>Face detection</b></a> - If this is enabled, then the camera will automatically try to detect faces, and use
them for the focus, metering (exposure) and white balance. Faces will be drawn as yellow squares when detected.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If this option is enabled, then you will not be able to touch to manually select the focus area, and
    the white balance option will have no effect (since the face recognition will be used to determine these).</li>
    <li>If Camera2 API is enabled, then the scene mode option will also have no effect (again since the face recognition
    option overrides this).</li>
    <li>If you are using an accessibility service such as Google Talkback, information about the number and
    location of detected faces will be reported when face detection is enabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Timer</b> - Set a timer for taking photos or recording video. Press the take photo/video button again to
cancel the timer.</p>

<!--<p><b>Burst mode</b> - Take a repeated set of photos when the take photo button is pressed. Press the take photo
button again to cancel.</p>-->

<p><b>Repeat mode interval</b> - Specify the delay (if any) between photos in repeat mode. Note that if a delay
is selected, note that this does not include the time taken to auto-focus and take each photo. Similarly, "No
delay" still means there will be some time between each photo. If you want to take a burst of photos, use the
Fast Burst photo mode, or long press the "take photo" button in Standard or Fast Burst photo modes.
(Burst mode only supported on some devices; requires Camera2 API to be enabled).</p>

<p><b>More camera controls...</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Touch to capture</b> - This option allows you to take a photo either just by touching or double-tapping on the
preview screen. Note that starting/stopping video recording is still performed in the normal way; this option only
affects taking photos.</p>

<p><b>Pause after taking photo</b> - If ticked, after taking a photo the display will pause, with options to share
<img src="share.png" alt="Share icon" width="32" height="32"> or delete
<img src="trash.png" alt="Trash icon" width="32" height="32"> the
photo. To keep the photo and continue, touch the screen, press back, or take another photo. Note that this isn't supported
when holding the shutter button to take a continuous burst of photos.</p>

<p><b>Shutter sound</b> - Whether to play a sound after taking a photo. (Requires Android 4.2 or higher to disable, and even
then isn't supported on all devices.) For Camera2 API, this also controls whether to play a sound for start/stop video
recording.</p>

<p><b>Timer beep</b> - Whether to beep when the timer is counting down, or for the repeat mode delay (see below).</p>

<p><b>Voice timer countdown</b> - Whether to give a voice countdown when the timer is counting down, or for the repeat mode
delay (see below).</p>

<p><b>Volume keys</b> - You can set what happens when your device's volume keys are pressed:</p><ul>
<li>Take photo or start/stop video (depending on photo/video mode).</li>
<li>Trigger an autofocus - or if in manual mode, change the focus distance in/out. In this mode, holding down both volume keys
will take a photo (or start/stop video). This makes your volume keys behave more like a physical camera button - hold down one
key to focus, then both to take a photo.</li>
<li>Zoom in/out.</li>
<li>Change the exposure compensation (or if in manual ISO mode and using Camera2 API, change the ISO).</li>
<li>Switch <a href="#auto_stabilise">auto-level</a> on/off.</li>
<li>Change the device's volume as normal.</li>
<li>Do nothing.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Audio control options</b> - If enabled, this allows taking a photo (or starting video recording, depending on the mode)
by making a noise. An on-screen microphone button <img src="ic_mic_white_48dp.png" alt="Microphone icon" width="32" height="32"> will appear, to
start/stop listening. The "loud noise" option will listen for any noise (so you can remotely take a photo by saying "cheese",
whistling, or whatever you prefer). Note that leaving the listening turned on may use additional battery. The "voice command" option
listens specifically for saying "cheese" - so this has the advantage that it's less likely to be triggered unintentionally.
Note that this can't be used to stop video recording - if you want to have some remote control on video recording,
see the "Max duration of video" option.</p>

<p><b>Audio control sensitivity</b> - This controls how sensitive Open Camera is to noises, if "Audio control" is set to "Loud noise".
If you find it's taking photos too often unintentionally, or isn't responding to your sounds, try adjusting this option.</p>

<p><b>Bluetooth LE remote control</b> - Open Camera supports connecting to the Kraken Smart Housing via the options in
these settings. Once connected via Bluetooth, it should be possible to control Open Camera from the device. The on-screen
display of Open Camera will also display information from the Kraken (temperature and depth).</p>

<p><b>Lock photo/video orientation</b> - Normally the orientation of the photo/video will be rotated by some multiple of
90 degree such that the orientation looks right - e.g. if your device is held in portrait, the resultant image/video will
be in portrait. This option allows fixing the camera to either be in portrait or landscape. Note that if
<a href="#auto_stabilise">auto-level</a> is also enabled, it will have the effect of aligning photos to the nearest
90 degrees.</p>

<p><a name="save_location"><b>Save location</b></a> - Select the folder to store the photos in. Click on a folder
(or "Parent Folder") to navigate through the filesystem. Select "New Folder" to create a new folder in the currently
displayed folder. Select "Use Folder" to choose the currently displayed folder. Note that on Android, there are some
folders that cannot be written to - Open Camera will display a message if you try to use one of these folders. Once
you have specified a new save location, you can long press on the Gallery icon to quickly switch between recent save
locations. Note that if "Use Storage Access Framework" is selected, this option will instead show up the Android standard
file chooser - navigate to the desired folder, and click "SELECT". If you want to save to an SD card, see "How can I
save to my external SD card?" under the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p><b>Use Storage Access Framework</b> - If selected, Open Camera will instead use the Android
<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.html">Storage Access Framework</a>. This
has some advantages, such as using the standard Android file picker, and being the only way to save to SD cards on Android 5
- though it may be slightly slower to take photos. (Requires Android 5.0 or higher.)</p>

<!--Enter the folder to store the photos in. This can be either a relative path (e.g.,
OpenCamera or even something like MyPics/Camera) in which case the folder will be located inside the "DCIM"
folder (usually something like /sdcard/DCIM/ ). For more advanced users, if the folder name starts with "/", then
it indicates the full absolute path (e.g., /sdcard/Pictures/Photos ). Note that folder names are case sensitive.
OpenCamera will attempt to create the folder (and any sub-folders as required) if it doesn't exist. If you specify
a path that you don't have write permissions for, then OpenCamera will fail to save images/videos (and this will
be reported when you try to take a photo or video).-
You can also use this option to save to an external SD card, though unfortunately the path varies depending on the
device, so you'll have to look this up yourself (it's usually something inside /mnt/ ).-->

<p><b>Save photo prefix</b> - This option allows you to customise save filenames for photos.</p>

<p><b>Save video prefix</b> - This option allows you to customise save filenames for videos.</p>

<p><b>Time format for filename</b> - By default, Open Camera uses the local timezone for the save filenames, but you
can also select UTC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">(Coordinated Universal Time / Zulu Time)</a>.
For the latter option, a "Z" will be appended to the filename (e.g., "IMG_20160524_155116Z.jpg"). The Z (Zulu) suffix
is a standard convention for identifying UTC timestamps.</p>

<p><b>Show camera when locked</b> - If you have a lock screen on your device (e.g., PIN to unlock), Open Camera by
default will show above the lock screen - i.e., if locked, you won't have to enter the PIN to use Open Camera. The
device still needs to be unlocked in order to go to the Settings or Gallery. If you would prefer Open Camera to always
be unavailable when your device is locked, you can disable this option.</p>

<p><b>Perform auto-focus on startup</b> - Whether Open Camera should auto-focus when starting the camera. Some devices
have a bug where the flash turns on when this happens, so a workaround is to disable this option.</p>

<p><b>Allow long press actions</b> - Some icons support a "long press" action (touching and holding on the icon). For example,
long press on the gallery icon to change the save location, or in some cases long press on the shutter icon will enable a
burst. If you prefer, you can disable these long press actions.</p>

<p><b>Calibrate level angle</b> - The options <a href="#auto_stabilise">Auto-level</a>, "Show angle" and "Show angle line"
rely on your device's ability to detect which orientation it's being held (the accelerometer). On some device's this might not
be calibated correctly. If so, you can use this option to calibrate the acceleromer (or reset the calibration back to the
default behaviour).</p>

<p><b>Camera preview...</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Preview size</b> - By default, Open Camera matches the aspect ratio of the preview (the image that is
    displayed on the phone/tablet's display) with that of the photo resolution ("Match photo size (WYSIWYG)" mode). The
    advantage is that what you see in the preview will match what will be in the resultant photo
    ("What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get") - though this may mean you will have "black bars" on the display in order to do
    this. If instead you select "Maximise preview size", then the camera preview will be as large as possible, trying to
    fill the available space. However if the resolution of the photo is a different aspect ratio to that of your device,
    this will result in the preview being cropped. In video mode, the preview is always in WYSIWYG mode.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Note that Android 4.4.3 <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=70830">introduced a bug</a>
        which means that the aspect ratio will be wrong if you select "Maximise preview size" (i.e., the preview will look
        squished). To avoid this problem, stick with "Match photo size".</li>
    <li>Also note that even in "Match photo size" mode, on some devices and resolutions, it may not be possible to match
        the preview to the resultant photo/video exactly; in such cases, Open Camera will try to match as closely as
        possible.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Ghost image</b> - You can overlay a previous photo. This is useful for aligning photos (e.g., for stop
    motion animation). This can also be used to create a custom "grid", by selecting an image with transparency.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Last photo taken</b> - When you take a photo, a ghost of that photo will be displayed. The ghost is
        reset either by leaving and returning to Open Camera, switching between photo/video modes, or turning
        this option off.</li>
    <li><b>Selected image</b> - Select a specific image on your device to be displayed as a ghost (requires
        Android 5). Note that for this option, the ghost image will not be displayed if Open Camera is running
        when your device is locked. If the image doesn't show at all, it may be that Open Camera was unable to
        load the selected image.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Ghost image opacity</b> - If a "Ghost image" is selected, this option controls how transparent/opaque the ghost
image should be drawn with.</p>

<p><b>Focus assist</b> - If enabled, this will show a zoomed in view on the camera preview when in manual focus mode, and you
    are changing the manual focus distance. Similarly in focus bracketing mode, the preview will zoom in when changing the focus
    distances to bracket between. Note not supported when recording video.</p>

<p><b>Show zoom</b> - Whether to display the current zoom level of the camera (when zoomed in).</p>

<p><b>Show angle</b> - Whether to display the orientation angle of the device's camera.</p>

<p><b>Show angle line</b> - Whether to display a horizontal "level" line that visually indicates the orientation of the device.</p>

<p><b>Show pitch lines</b> - Whether to display horizontal pitch lines that visually indicate the pitch of the device.</p>

<p><b>Angle highlight color</b> - This controls the color to be used for the angle display and "level" line when the camera is nearly
    level; and also for the 0 degree pitch line when the camera is held at nearly zero pitch.</p>

<p><b>Show compass direction</b> - Whether to display the compass direction of the device's camera.</p>

<p><b>Show compass direction lines</b> - Whether to display vertical lines that visually indicate the compass direction of the device.</p>

<p><b>Show battery</b> - Whether to display the current battery level.</p>

<p><b>Show time</b> - Whether to display the current time.</p>

<p><b>Show camera ID</b> - For devices with multiple front/back cameras. Whether to display the currently used camera ID.
    This will be a value starting from 0, that distinguishes between the different cameras on your device.</p>

<p><b>Show free memory</b> - Whether to display the remaining storage space of the device.</p>

<p><b>Show ISO</b> - If selected, the current ISO, exposure time and frame rate (FPS) will be displayed (only available if Camera2
    API is used). The text will be shown in red when the auto-exposure routine is scanning. In flash auto mode, a flash symbol will
    also indicate when flash will fire. Note that this is not an absolute guarantee - when you take a photo, the camera will make an
    updated decision on whether to fire the flash, which in some cases may disagree with whether the flash symbol was displayed.</p>

<p><b>Show a histogram</b> - Allows displaying an on-screen histogram (only available if Camera2 API is used). Note that the
    histogram reflects the currently display on-screen preview, and will not necessarily be accurate for the final resultant photograph,
    especially if modes such as NR, DRO, HDR are used. Also note that displaying a histogram may use more battery.
    The follow options are available:</p>
<ul>
    <li>RGB Colors - Displays a histogram for each color channel.</li>
    <li>Luminance - The brightness is computed as a weighted average of the RGB components: 0.299*R + 0.587G + 0.114*B.</li>
    <li>Value - The brightness is computed as the maximum of the RGB components.</li>
    <li>Intensity - The brightness is computed as an unweighted average of the RGB components.</li>
    <li>Lightness - The brightness is computed as an average of the minimum and maximum of the RGB components.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Show zebra stripes</b> - Allows displaying on-screen zebra stripes (also known as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_patterning">zebra patterning</a>) to show whether the
    image is over-exposed (only available if Camera2 API is used). Note when using photo modes NR and HDR,
    a region that is shown as over-exposed on-screen may not necessarily be over-exposed in the resultant image,
    since these modes are able to better handle a high dynamic range. Also note that enabling zebra stripes
    may use more battery.</p>

<p><b>Zebra stripes foreground/background colour</b> - If "Show zebra stripes" is enabled, these options allow you to
choose the colours of the stripes.</p>

<p><b>Focus peaking</b> - Allows displaying on-screen highlights to indicate edges (contours) that are in-focus
    (only available if Camera2 API is used). This is particularly useful in conjunction with manual focus mode, to help show
    which regions of the image are in focus. Note that enabling focus peaking may use more battery.</p>

<p><b>Focus peaking color</b> - This controls the color to be used for the highlights when "Focus peaking" is enabled.</p>

<p><b>Show audio level meter</b> - If selected, when recording video an on-screen meter will display the current audio level.</p>

<p><b>Show a grid</b> - Whether to display one of a choice of grids on the camera preview. Grids are useful in photography to help
    compose your image. Options are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>3x3 - helps with applying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">rule of thirds</a>.</li>
    <li>Phi 3x3 - 3x3 grid with ratios 1:0.618:1.</li>
    <li>4x2</li>
    <li>Crosshair</li>
    <li>Golden - displays a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral">Golden spiral</a> (or technically,
        a Fibonacci spiral). You can use this to improve your photography.</li>
    <li>Golden Triangles</li>
    <li>Diagonals</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Show a crop guide</b> - A crop guide is a rectangle displayed on-screen, which has the specified aspect ratio
    (if different to the photo/video aspect ratio). This is useful if you plan to crop the resultant photos or videos
    to a particular aspect ratio. For photos, the crop-guide requires "Preview size" to be set to WYSIWYG mode.</p>

<p><b>Show thumbnail animation</b> - Whether to display the moving thumbnail animation when taking a photo.</p>

<p><b>Show border when taking photo</b> - Whether to display a border effect when taking a photo.</p>

<p><b>Rotate preview</b> - this option rotates the on-screen preview by 180 degrees (i.e., upside down). Most users
    won't ever need this, but this option can be useful if you are using Open Camera with equipment such as zoom lenses
    which invert the image. Note that this doesn't rotate the resultant photos/videos - you'll still have to rotate those
    yourself afterwards - but this will correct the preview so that you can still see what you are shooting properly.</p>

<p><b>On screen GUI...</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>UI placement</b> - Allows you to choose between various layouts for the on-screen user interface icons.</p>

<p><b>Immersive mode</b> - Allows you to choose between various modes which affect the behaviour of the user-interface, in order to
make it more immersive (requires Android 4.4 or higher):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Off</b> - Don't use immersive mode, and on-screen virtual navigation buttons are always visible.</li>
<li><b>Only dim on-screen virtual navigation buttons (default)</b> - Don't use immersive mode, but on-screen virtual
navigation buttons are dimmed. Note that some devices don't support virtual navigation buttons being dimmed, in
which case this option is the same as "Off".</li>
<li><b>Hide on-screen virtual navigation buttons</b> - After a short delay, any on-screen virtual navigation buttons will disappear.<li>
<li><b>Hide GUI</b> - After a short delay, any on-screen virtual navigation buttons will disappear, along with most of the GUI buttons.
To exit this immersive mode, either touch on-screen, or swipe in from the top/bottom sides when the device is held in landscape (or
left/right sides if held in portrait).</li>
<li><b>Hide everything</b> - Same as "Hide GUI", but when in immersive mode everything will disappear except the camera preview. This
mode probably isn't useful for most people (since you need to exit immersive mode even to take a photo), but is available if you wish
to only have the preview showing.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Show face detection icon</b> - Whether to display an on-screen icon for enabling or disabling face detection. See
    <a href="#auto_stabilise">Auto-level feature</a> above for more details.</p>

<p><b>Show flash icon</b> - Whether to display an on-screen icon for cycling through flash modes. If this is enabled, then
flash modes won't show on the popup menu. Also note that it is not possible to enable the torch with this method.</p>

<p><b>Show auto-level icon</b> - Whether to display an on-screen icon for enabling or disabling auto-level. See
    <a href="#face_detection">Settings/"Face detection"</a> above for more details.</p>

<p><b>Show stamp photo icon</b> - Whether to display an on-screen icon for enabling or disabling photo stamp. See
    <a href="#stamp_photos">Settings/Photo settings/"Stamp photos"</a> for more details.</p>

<p><b>Show custom text stamp photo icon</b> - Whether to display an on-screen icon for setting a custom text to stamp onto
    resultant photos. See
    <a href="#custom_text">Settings/Photo settings/"Custom text"</a> for more details.</p>

<p><b>Show store location data icon</b> - Whether to display an on-screen icon for enabling or disabling storing location
    data (geotagging). See <a href="#store_location_data">Settings/Location settings/"Store location data (geotagging)"</a>
    for more details.</p>

<p><b>Show RAW icon</b> - Whether to display an on-screen icon for cycling through RAW modes (Standard, Standard+RAW, RAW only).
    <a href="#raw">See Settings/Photo settings/"RAW"</a> for more details.</p>

<p><b>Show auto white balance lock icon</b> - Whether to display an on-screen icon for locking or unlocking auto white
    balance.</p>

<p><b>Show auto exposure lock icon</b> - Whether to display an on-screen icon for locking or unlocking auto exposure.</p>

<p><b>Show zoom -/+ controls</b> - Whether to display -/+ buttons to control zoom.</p>

<p><b>Show zoom slider controls</b> - Whether to display to a slider to control zoom.</p>

<p><b>Show "Take Photo" icon</b> - Whether to display the
<img src="take_photo.png" alt="Take Photo icon" width="16" height="16">
icon for taking a photo (or recording video). Uncheck if you'd
rather take photos by other methods (e.g., if your device has a hardware shutter button, or using the volume keys).</p>

<p><b>Show on-screen messages</b> - Open Camera will sometimes display temporary on-screen text with information (in some
    cases using "toasts"). This option can be used to disable them.</p>

<p><b>Show What's New dialog</b> - When updating to a major new version, Open Camera displays a dialog explaining the new
features and other options. You can disable this dialog from being displayed if you prefer.</p>

<p><b>Multiple cameras icon</b> - This option only shows on devices with more than one front and/or back cameras. When
enabled (the default), such devices will have two on-screen icons: one to switch between front/back cameras, and another
to switch between the multiple front or back cameras. If this option is disabled, only a single icon will show, which
will cycle between all cameras.</p>

<p><b>Keep display on</b> - Whether to force keeping the screen display on, while the main Open Camera UI is active.</p>

<p><b>Force maximum brightness</b> - Whether to force the screen display to maximum brightness.</p>

<p><b>Photo and Video Settings:</b></p>

<p><b>Photo settings</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Camera resolution</b> - Select the resolution of photo images taken by the camera.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If <a href="#auto_stabilise">auto-level</a> is enabled, images will in general come out as a
        slightly lower resolution (due to the rotation and cropping that's required).
    </li>
    <li>Note that in some photo modes, the actual photo mode may be different to that selected here.
        For example, advanced photo modes such as HDR, NR, Fast Burst, Expo Bracketing may have a
        maximum supported resolution - if the resolution selected here is too high, the largest
        allowed resolution will instead be used. To see the resolution currently used (or to change
        it), see the "Camera resolution" setting on the popup menu.
    </li>
    <li>The resolution setting is ignored altogether in Panorama mode.
    </li>
</ul>



<p><b>Image quality</b> - The image quality of saved JPEG or WebP images. Higher means better quality, but the image files will take up
more storage space. Note that 100% does not necessarily mean there is no lossy compression, rather that there is minimum
compression. Also note this option has no effect if "Image format" is set to PNG.</p>

<p><b>Image format</b> - The image file format for saving photos:</p>
<ul>
    <li>JPEG - This is the fastest option. Also note that only JPEG supports saving various photo
    metadata (Exif), including camera details, location, and artist/copyright tags.</li>
    <li>WebP - This is an alternative (lossy) file format to JPEG. It offers smaller file sizes,
    but saving takes longer, and some applications may not support WebP images. Note that WebP
    images are generated by converting from a JPEG with 100% quality (since the Android camera API does not
    have native WebP output).</li>
    <li>PNG - This is a lossless format, but note that file sizes will be large, and saving will
    take significantly longer. Note that this doesn't mean there will be absolute no loss in quality:
    cameras on Android offer images in JPEG or RAW (DNG) file formats. When using PNG, Open Camera
    receives the JPEG with the quality set to 100%, and converts to PNG - this means that there is minimal
    lossy compression. The only way to have truly lossless is via RAW (see option below).</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="raw"><b>RAW</b></a> - Only available if Camera2 API is used. If set to "Standard and DNG (RAW)", then photos
will also be saved in RAW (DNG) format. If set to "DNG (RAW) only" (requires Android 7), then photos
will only be saved in DNG format. DNG stands for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Negative">"digital negative"</a>, and contains the full
uncompressed and unprocessed information from your camera. Please note the following points:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some gallery applications don't recognise DNG files - if this is the case, you won't even see them listed.
    Either install a gallery application that does, or use specialised RAW viewer or editing tools.
    Or transfer to a PC to use DNG editing applications there. Note that newer versions of Android
    (7 onwards) seem to have better support for DNG images.</li>
    <li>If your gallery application doesn't show DNG files, a file explorer application may also be useful,
    to delete DNGs if you don't want them (DNGs take up a lot of space - and won't be deleted when you delete
    the corresponding JPEG from a Gallery application).</li>
    <li>Note that various processing options such as DRO photo mode, "Stamp photos" and <a href="#auto_stabilise">"Auto-level"</a> will only apply
    to the JPEG images, and not the DNG images. This is not a bug - the DNGs represent the RAW output
    of the camera device. This also means that these options have no relevance for photos in "DNG (RAW) only" mode, therefore such
    options will not show on the popup menu.</li>
    <li>Options to store extra Exif tags ("Store compass direction", "Artist", "Copyright") are only supported for
    JPEG format.</li>
    <li>Some devices only support saving RAW images in the Standard or DRO photo modes. Higher end devices will also support saving RAW
    images also in Expo Bracketing and Focus Bracketing modes, as well as HDR where "Save all images for HDR mode" is enabled.
    The on-screen "RAW" icon will show if RAW is enabled for the current photo mode.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Allow RAW for expo bracketing</b> - If this option is disabled, the RAW images won't ever be saved in expo bracketing or HDR
    photo modes.</p>

<p><b>Allow RAW for focus bracketing</b> - If this option is disabled, the RAW images won't ever be saved in focus bracketing photo
    mode.</p>

<p><b>Noise Reduction original images</b> - When using <a href="#noise_reduction">Noise Reduction</a> mode, if
    this option is enabled, then the input images from the burst of images taken will be saved, as well as the
    final NR photo. You can choose to save either a single image from the burst, or all images. This may be useful
    if you want to use external image stacking applications to merge the images. Note that these images will
    typically be noisier than a typical photo from Standard mode, because the device's noise reduction algorithms
    are disabled (this seems counter-intuitive, but in order to improve quality by merging multiple images, noise
    reduction algorithms need to be applied after the merging, not before).
</p>

<p><b>Save all images for HDR mode</b> - When using <a href="#hdr">HDR</a> mode, if this option is enabled,
then the three base exposure images will be saved as well as the final HDR photo. This is useful if you want
to use external HDR applications (such as my own
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.opencamera.vibrancehdr">Vibrance HDR</a> for Android,
or various HDR applications for PC) to
create the final HDR image (although if you don't want Open Camera's HDR mode at all, you can instead use the
Exposure Bracketing Photo Mode). Note this will make saving slower, especially if options like "Stamp photos" or
<a href="#auto_stabilise">Auto-level</a> are also used.</p>

<p><b>HDR contrast enhancement</b> - When using <a href="#hdr">HDR</a> mode, in some (bright) scenes a local contrast
enhancement algorithm is applied to improve the look of the image. It also gives such images a look that is stereotypically
associated with "HDR". If you prefer not to apply this at all, you can change this option from "Smart" to "Off". Or you can
choose "Always" to have it applied in all cases.</p>

<p><b>Exposure Bracketing</b> - Specifies the total number of images to save in Exposure Bracketing Photo Mode
(Camera2 API only).</p>

<p><b>Exposure Bracketing Stops</b> - Specifies the number of stops to subtract/add from the "base"
exposure level to the darkest/brightest image, in Exposure Bracketing Photo Mode. An increase of 1
stop means a doubling of the amount of light. So a setting of "2", with 3 images, will produce
images with exposure set to [-2, 0, +2]. For 5 images, this will produce [-2, -1, 0, +1, +2].</p>

<p><b>Panorama auto-crop</b> - Normally <a href="#pano">panoramas</a> are cropped to give a rectangular result.
Disabling this option will show the full extent of the panorama, but will leave wavy black borders.</p>

<p><b>Panorama original images</b> - Whether to save the original shots in <a href="#pano">Panorama</a> mode. This can be useful
if you want to use a third party application to stitch the images together to create a panorama. Note that these original
images are always saved in PNG format. This option can also be useful for debugging purposes, to send me example images when
reporting problems with panorama - for this, it's best to select to include the debug XML file (note that you'll typically need
a third party File Explorer application to see and delete XML files on Android).</p>

<p><b>Front camera mirror</b> - Normally for front cameras, the preview will behave like a mirror, but resultant
photos will still be as the camera (or other people) view the scene. This option can be used to mirror the
resultant photo, so the resultant photo matches the mirrored image you see on the screen.</p>

<p><b>Artist</b> - If text is entered in this setting, then the text will be stored in the image's Exif metadata as the
    "Artist" tag. Only supported for JPEG format. Not supported for RAW photos (DNG format). (Requires Android 7.)</p>

<p><b>Copyright</b> - If text is entered in this setting, then the text will be stored in the image's Exif metadata as the
    "Copyright" tag. Only supported for JPEG format. Not supported for RAW photos (DNG format). (Requires Android 7.)</p>

<p><a name="stamp_photos"><b>Stamp photos</b></a> - Option to add a date and timestamp to the resultant photos. If "Store
location data" is enabled (see "Location settings" below), then the current location latitude
and longitude coordinates, and altitude, will also be stamped on the resultant photos (if the location is known).
Similarly for "Store compass direction". Note that if this option is enabled, then it will take
longer to save the photo. Also see "Video subtitles".</p>

<p><b>Datestamp format, Timestamp format</b> - If "Stamp photos" is enabled, these options allow
extra control over the date and time formatting. Also used for Video settings/"Video subtitles".</p>

<p><b>GPS stamp format</b> - If "Stamp photos" is enabled, this allows extra control over the GPS
formatting. Also used for Video settings/"Video subtitles".</p>

<p><b>Use addresses</b> - If "Stamp photos" and "Store location data" is enabled, this allows the location
    to be displayed on the resultant photo in the form of an address, either as well as or instead of GPS
    coordinates. Note that an Internet connection is required for this to succeed. Also used for
    Video settings/"Video subtitles".</p>

<p><b>Distance unit</b> - If "Stamp photos" is enabled, this controls whether to use metres (m) or
feet (ft) when recording the GPS altitude. Also used for Video settings/"Video subtitles".</p>

<p><a name="custom_text"><b>Custom text</b></a> - Here you can enter some text to be stamped onto resultant photos (e.g.,
this could be used for a copyright image). Note that if this option is enabled, then it will take
longer to save the photo. Also note that this option is only supported for photos, not video.</p>

<p><b>Font size</b> - Sets the font size used for text for options "Stamp photos" or
"Custom text".</p>

<p><b>Font color</b> - Sets the font color used for text for options "Stamp photos" or
"Custom text".</p>

<p><b>Text style</b> - Whether to render the text on the image with a shadow background effect, for
options "Stamp photos" or "Custom text".</p>

<p><b>Use alternative flash method</b> - (Camera2 API only.) Unfortunately many devices have poor support for the
Camera2 API. A common issue is poor flash behaviour (either flash doesn't fire, or photos are over or under exposed).
If so, enabling this option may help - this uses an alternative algorithm for flash (using the torch to simulate flash
as a workaround). Note that this is enabled by default for Samsung devices.</p>

<p><b>Enable fast HDR/expo burst</b> - (Camera2 API only.) Disable this option if your device has problems taking photos
in HDR or Exposure Bracketing photo modes (disabling this option will result in a longer delay between the photos being
taken, but may give more stable behaviour if your device is having problems with this).</p>

<p><b>Allow photos whilst recording video</b> - (Camera2 API only.) Some devices support taking photos whilst recording video,
but there's the problem that enabling such functionality make cause problems with regular video recording. If you have problems
recording video with Camera2 API enabled, try disabling this option.</p>

<!--<p><b>Use background thread</b> - Whether to process and save photo in the background. Normally this should
be left set to true for faster operation, but it's an option just in case.</p>-->

<p><b>Video settings</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Video resolution</b> - Select the resolution of videos taken by the camera.</p>

<p><b>Enable digital video stabilization</b> - Video stabilization reduces the shaking due to the motion of the camera in
both the preview and in recorded videos. This enables a digital method in the camera driver, and may be unnecessary if
your device supports optical image stabilization (OIS).</p>

<p><b>Video format</b> - Allows choice of various video file formats and codecs. Please test before using, as some may
not work properly on all devices! Also note:</p><ul>
    <li>WebM does not support recording video (at the time of writing, it seems encoding in Vorbis audio format is
    <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats#audio-formats">not supported</a> on
    Android).</li>
    <li>WebM does not support storing location data ("Store location data" option).</li>
    <li>If using 3GPP, then restarting video when hitting maximum filesize will not be seamless (even on Android 8).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Video picture profiles</b> - Enables different color profiles for recording video. Only available if Camera2
    API is used, and only supported on some devices. Additional notes:</p><ul>
    <li>The various "log" profiles enable a "flat" color profile, and are intended to create videos
        for further editing in post production.</li>
    <li>Note that it may be necessary to increase the video bitrate when shooting with a "log" profile
        or with high custom gamma.</li>
    <li>When "Gamma" is selected, you can specify the gamma value used with the next option "Video gamma value".</li>
    <li>This feature is somewhat experimental, please test if it fits your need before shooting your masterpiece!</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Max duration of video</b> - This option can be used to set a maximum duration of the video. If set, video recording
will stop after the specified time (unless already stopped earlier).</p>

<p><b>Restart video after max duration</b> - If a max duration has been set (see above), this option can be used to make
the video automatically stop and restart the specified number of times. So this can be used to take a video for a long
period, broken up into multiple video files. If a max duration has not been set, then this option has no effect.</p>

<p><b>Maximum file size of video</b> - This allows to set a maximum file size for videos. Note that many Android devices
set a maximum file size (typically around 2GB or 4GB), and there is no way Open Camera can work around such a limitation (and
using exFAT doesn't get round it). This option allows you to set a smaller maximum file size - note that it can only
be used to reduce the device's maximum file size (so if a device has a 2GB limit, you can't increase it by setting this option to
a larger value). Note that the value is approximate - typically
the resultant videos may be slightly smaller. Note that if you using this option together
with "Max duration of video", then - if "Restart on maximum file size" is enabled - hitting the maximum file size will cause a
restart that doesn't reset the max duration timer, nor does it count as one of the number of restarts. E.g., if you requested a
maximum duration of 30m, with 1 restart, but the video hits the maximum file size after 20m, rather than getting two times 30m
videos, you'd get four videos, of lengths 20m, 10m, 20m, 10m (i.e., the 30m videos are split at the maximum file sizes). If
"Restart on maximum file size" is disabled, then hitting the maximum file size will always cause the video to end without
restarting, even if you've set "Restart video after max duration".</p>

<p><b>Restart on maximum file size</b> - Whether to automatically restart if the maximum file size is met. As noted above, almost all
Android devices have a maximum file size for videos, even if you don't explicitly set one. So it's advisable to keep this option to true,
so that Open Camera will restart as soon as possible if you're recording video, and hit this limit. Note that on devices that
are not running Android 8 or later, there will still be a loss of a few seconds while the video stops and restarts. On Android 8
or later, the resume should be seamless (unless using 3GPP video file format).</p>

<p><b>Record audio</b> - Whether to record audio when recording a video.</p>

<p><b>Audio source</b> - Select the audio source for recording video. The effect of this depends on your device -
if it supports an external microphone, you may be able to use this by selecting "External mic". The other options may
provide different settings affecting the resultant audio (e.g., automatic gain control), though this behaviour is
device specific. These options are just controls for the Android MediaRecorder API, and so the exact behaviour is
up to the device.</p>

<p><b>Audio channels</b> - If recording audio with video, this option allows you to specify mono or stereo recording.
Note that most devices do not support stereo recording. Even for devices that do support this, you may need to modify
the "Audio source" option to another value for this to work.</p>

<p><b>Lock screen when recording video</b> - If enabled, the GUI will be locked when recording video (i.e., the GUI
won't respond to touch presses). You can use this to prevent accidental presses that might change settings or stop
recording. To unlock the GUI, swipe the screen (in any direction). Note that this won't prevent the video being
stopped if you press your device's Home, Recent Apps or Power button (it is not possible for apps to override the
behaviour of these buttons).</p>

<p><b>Video subtitles</b> - This option is analogous to the "Stamp photos" option, but rather than embedding text into
the video itself, it stores the text in a separate subtitles
(<a href="https://matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/srt.html">".SRT"</a>) file. Most decent video players should support
SRT files, and use them to display the information as subtitles. The subtitles will record the date and time. If "Store location data" is enabled (see
"Location settings" below), then the current location latitude and longitude coordinates will also be recorded (if the location is
known). Similarly for "Store compass direction". Note that you can control the formatting style for date, time and location using
the options under the "Photo settings" menu (Datestamp format, Timestamp format, GPS stamp format, Distance unit).</p>

<p><b>Video bitrate (approx)</b> - If set to a value other than "default", the default video bitrate is overridden. Higher values mean better
    quality video, but the files take up more disk space. Note that some values may be unsupported by your device, and may
    cause the recording to fail - in some cases, this can cause problems with the camera that require a reboot to fix. So
    please test before using. Also note that the bitrate setting is approximate - the resultant video file will typically be slightly different
    to that requested.</p>

<p><b>Video frame rate (approx)</b> - If set to a value other than "default", the camera will try to match this frame
    rate.</p>
<ul>
    <li>This is very approximate, as frame rate depends on many factors such as your device and lighting
        conditions, and this is only a "recommendation" to the camera driver, so there is no guarantee that the
        resultant video's frame rate will match with the requested value.</li>
    <li>Some frame rate values may be unsupported by your device, and cause the recording to fail, so please test before
        using.</li>
    <li>Even if video recording is successful, if achieving a specific FPS is desired, please check the resultant video's
        frame rate rather than assuming that it was achieved.</li>
    <li>For best results (especially for 120fps or higher), please set Settings/"Camera API" to "Camera2 API".</li>
    <li>This setting is ignored in slow motion mode, where instead Open Camera will choose an appropriate high speed frame
        rate.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Force 4K UHD video (may not work on all devices)</b> - Enable recording in 4K UHD (3840x2160) on the back camera (if ticked,
this overrides the setting in "Video resolution"). This is provided for some phones that don't properly expose their 4K video resolution to 3rd party camera apps
(and so 4K resolution doesn't show in the Video resolution option above).
It turns out that some such devices can be made to record in 4K resolution if it's requested, but on other devices this won't work.
If you enable this on a device that doesn't support it, you may either get an error
message when you try to record, or it may succeed but create a video where the resolution isn't 4K, or may even result in a crash! So
please test this out first. I've tested this successfully on a Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 3, but even there it only works on some
variants of those devices. If this doesn't work, it isn't a bug in Open Camera, it's because your device doesn't support 4K recording
for third party camera apps. (If this option doesn't show up at all, it's either because your device already lists 4K in the Video
resolutions options above, or because Open Camera thinks this is a device that probably doesn't support 4K video.)</p>

<p><b>Critical battery check</b> - If a device runs out of power while recording video, in theory the video should safely stop in time.
However in some cases this doesn't happen in time (if the video file is large, post-processing may still be occurring when the device
switches off), causing the entire video file to be corrupted! To reduce this risk, Open Camera will stop video recording when the
battery level is low (3%), but before the device is about to shut off. If for some reason you don't want this behaviour, you can
switch this option off.</p>

<p><b>Flash while recording video</b> - If enabled, the camera flash will flash every second while recording video. This
isn't something most people will need, but it can be useful if the phone is being operated remotely, as a signal that the
video is still recording.</p>

<p><b>Location settings</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><a name="store_location_data"><b>Store location data (Geotagging)</b></a> - If selected, then photos will be tagged with the current
location. Location data will also be stored in videos (though only for devices that record in MPEG4 or
3GPP formats).</p>

<p><b>Store compass direction</b> - If selected, then photos will be tagged with the compass direction.
Only supported for JPEG format. Not supported for RAW photos (DNG format) or videos.</p>

<p><b>Store compass direction</b> - If selected, then photos will be tagged with the device's yaw, pitch and roll.
    Note that Exif data does not have direct support for this, instead it will be written as a string in the Exif data's
    User Comment for the image. Only supported for JPEG format. Not supported for RAW photos (DNG format) or videos.</p>

<p><b>Require location data</b> - If "Store location data" is enabled, then also enabling this option means that
photos and videos can only be taken if location data is present (this can be useful if you need pictures/videos to
have location data in them).</p>

<p><b>Processing settings</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Anti-banding</b> - Some kinds of lighting, such as some fluorescent lights, flicker at the rate of the power supply
frequency (60Hz or 50Hz, depending on country). While this is typically not noticeable to a person, it can be visible to
a camera. If a camera sets its exposure time to the wrong value, the flicker may become visible in the viewfinder as flicker
or in a final captured image, as a set of variable-brightness bands across the image. Therefore, the auto-exposure routines
of the camera include antibanding routines that ensure that the chosen exposure value will not cause such banding. The choice
of exposure time depends on the rate of flicker, which the camera can detect automatically, or the expected rate can be
specified by using this option.</p>

<p><b>Edge mode algorithm</b> - Only available if Camera2 API is used. Allows control over the algorithm used by the camera
    driver for applying edge enhancement. Edge enhancement improves sharpness and details in the captured image, though on
    some devices you may prefer to turn it off if it introduces undesirable effects. Note that this setting is ignored in
    Noise Reduction (NR) photo mode.</p>

<p><b>Noise reduction mode algorithm</b> - Only available if Camera2 API is used. Allows control over the algorithm used by the camera
    driver for applying noise reduction. On some devices you may prefer to turn it off if it introduces undesirable effects.
    Note that this setting is not related to Open Camera's Noise Reduction (NR) photo mode (and in fact this setting is ignored
    in NR photo mode).</p>

<p><b>Camera API</b> - If set to "Camera2 API", this enables support for the Camera2 API that was introduced
in Android 5. Changing this setting will cause Open Camera to restart. Camera2 API enables more advanced features
(including manual ISO/exposure, manual focus, HDR, exposure bracketing).
Note that not all Android 5+ devices have full support for the Camera2 API (Open Camera will only show this
option if at least one camera reports either "LIMITED" or "FULL" support for the API; "LEGACY" only devices are not supported).
Also note that even if devices support Camera2 API, some
devices have poor support.
These are not necessarily bugs in Open Camera, but problems with manufacturer support for Camera2 API. If you have
problems with flash behaviour, try the "Use alternative flash method" setting under "Photo Settings".

<p><b>Open Source licences</b> - Licences for files used in Open Camera.</p>

<p><b>Settings manager</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Save settings</b> - Open Camera supports saving all of its settings to a file, so that you can
    restore them later. This could potentially be used for saving different profiles or presets.
    The files are saved inside <small>Android/data/net.sourceforge.opencamera/files/backups/</small> .
    Please note that all backup files are removed in Open Camera is uninstalled (or you clear Open
    Camera's data in your device's Settings/Apps), unless you manually copy them elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Restore settings</b> - Restores all settings from a previously saved settings file (see
    "Save settings"). A file dialog will appear allowing you to choose the settings file. Be warned
    that selecting a file will mean all of Open Camera's settings will be overwritten with the
    saved version! Also beware of using this to transfer settings between different devices - there
    is the risk that settings on some devices may be incompatible with other devices. Also if the
    saved settings file specified a save location, this may not be valid on the new device (or if
    using "Storage Access Framework", you may have to reselect the folder in Open Camera, to grant
    write permission for the folder).</p>

<p><b>Reset settings</b> - Resets all Open Camera settings to their default. Selecting this option will cause
Open Camera to restart. Note that this will not delete any saved settings (see above options).</p>

<p><a name="widgets"><b>Widgets and tiles</b></a></p>

<p>Open Camera comes with a "Take Photo" widget. You can place this on your homescreen. When clicked
on, it lauches Open Camera and takes a photo immediately.</p>

<p>Open Camera also comes with two widgets that can be
<a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2781801">displayed on the lock screen</a>
(requires Android 4.2 or later - but lock screen widgets are no longer available in Android 5 or later).
The "Open Camera" widget launches the app; the "Take Photo" widget will also automatically take
a photo. Note that if you have a PIN lock etc, you'll have to unlock even if "Show camera when locked"
is enabled.</p>

<p>On Android 7, Open Camera supports Quick Settings Tiles, to launch Open Camera in photo mode

<p><a name="faq"><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></a></p>

<p><b>How can I save to my external SD card?</b> - This depends on your Android version:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Android 4.3 or below</b> - Select <a href="#save_location">Save location</a> under Settings/"More
camera controls", and navigate to a folder on your SD card. Unfortunately the path varies depending on
the device, so you'll have to look this up or find it out yourself - it's usually one of the folders
inside /storage/ (press "Parent Folder" until you're in "/storage/") or
/mnt/ (press "Parent Folder" until you're in "/", then select "mnt"). Then have a look inside one
of the folders in there - note that confusingly it won't be "sdcard", but will be named something else,
e.g., "extSdCard".</li>
<li><b>Android 4.4</b> - Unfortunately it is not possible for 3rd party apps to write to external SD cards.
<b>This is not a bug or missing feature in Open Camera</b>, rather that
<a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/02/17/external-blues-google-has-brought-big-changes-to-sd-cards-in-kitkat-and-even-samsung-may-be-implementing-them/">Google
have blocked write access to external SD cards in Android 4.4</a>. There is one exception: if you use a
folder in <small>Android/data/net.sourceforge.opencamera/</small> on your SD card (use the "New folder" option to create
the folders/sub-folders if necessary), that should allow saving to the SD card. <b>Note that all files in this
folder will be deleted if you uninstall Open Camera</b>, so be careful that you don't lose your photo/videos
if you use this method, and then uninstall!</li>
<li><b>Android 5.0 onwards</b> - The restrictions on SD cards introduced in Android 4.4 still apply, however
instead you can enable Settings/More camera controls/"Use Storage Access Framework", and this should allow you
to save to external SD cards. If when choosing a folder, you only see "Recent", you may need to click on the
three dots at the top right to open the menu, to enable showing the drives (e.g., "Show internal storage".</li>
<li><b>Android 6.0 onwards</b> - From Android 6, some devices support "Adoptable Storage" allowing you to
select to use
an SD card as internal storage. Note that not all devices support this, even if running Android 6 or later. If your device
doesn't support this, or you want to instead use an SD card as "portable storage", you'll have to use
the Storage Access Framework method as with Android 5 (or the <small>Android/data/net.sourceforge.opencamera/</small> method as
with Android 4.4).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Can you implement disabling shutter sound for my phone?</b> -
    If Open Camera shows the option Settings/"Camera API", then changing to "Camera2 API" means you'll be able to disable
    shutter sounds under "Settings/More camera controls...".
    When not using Camera2 API, if the option "Shutter sound" under "More camera controls..." isn't shown,
    then it's not available. There
    are possible workarounds for some of these devices (which is why some third party camera applications
    may be able to silence the shutter), though the issue is these don't work on all devices, and tend
    to use methods that Google now discourage. The fault is with the device for not supporting
    standard method for cameras to disable the shutter sound on Android. In particular, if under Settings/About
    you see that "Can disable shutter sound?" says No, it means the device's camera API is telling 3rd
    party camera apps that shutter sound can't be disabled (so either it can't do it, or the API is lying
    - either way, this should be reported to your manufacturer).</p>

<p><b>Photos or videos fail to save!</b> - Firstly, if you're trying to save to an
external SD card, see "How can I save to my external SD card?" above. Otherwise:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If Settings/More camera controls/"Use Storage Access Framework" is enabled,
    in some cases the permission may be lost, try rechoosing the save location (from
    Settings/More camera controls/"Save location").</li>
    <li>If not using Storage Access Framework, but you have changed the save location,
    it may be you've chosen somewhere where applications don't have permission to save
    files.</li>
    <li>Or sometimes simply restarting the devices fixes such problems.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>I switched to a new phone, and now something doesn't work!</b> - Google's auto-backup will
typically transfer settings to a new phone, but this may mean a camera-specific setting is no
longer relevant. In particular, if you set a non-default save location, it may be that the path is
not valid on the new device, or if using Settings/More camera controls/"Use Storage Access Framework",
you may need to rechoose the save location (from Settings/More camera controls/"Save location") to
grant permission to the new device. You can use Settings/Settings manager/"Reset settings" to reset
Open Camera to its original state, to rule out any issues from an Android backup from another
device.</p>

<p><b>My pictures are being rotated/cropped!</b> - This likely means the <a href="#auto_stabilise">auto-level</a>
option is on. (If they're being rotated even when the phone is held level, it may mean the accelerometer sensor on your
device isn't calibrated.) It's off by default, but you may have accidentally switched it on. To turn off, go to the "popup" menu
and untick Auto-level.</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't Open Camera support dual / multiple cameras?</b> - Open Camera supports switching between all cameras
that are made available to third party applications. Usually this means front and back cameras, but some devices have
multiple front and/or back-facing cameras. Use the
<img src="baseline_add_a_photo_white_48.png" alt="Switch multi-camera icon" width="16" height="16">switch multi-camera icon
to switch between multiple front or back cameras. In some cases the extra cameras aren't made available to third party
applications, so it isn't possible for Open Camera to support them. Even where they are, since there is no current standard
on what the extra cameras are used for, it can't do anything with them other than allowing you to switch between them.</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't Open Camera support the maximum video resolution on my device?</b> - If you
are using Camera2 API, make sure that you're not in slow motion mode (see "Speed" under
the popup menu), and you don't have a non-default frame rate set (under Settings/Video settings). If
a high speed frame rate is in use, then this usually limits the maximum video resolution. If this
isn't the case, then it may be that the device isn't exposing the highest video resolution to third
party applications (e.g., this is common for 4K/UHD video resolutions on older devices, especially
if Camera2 API isn't enabled).</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't the FPS/bitrate setting for video work?</b> - These settings only give "recommendations" to the
camera, and there is no guarantee that they will be met. For best chance of success, try setting Settings/"Camera API" to "Camera2 API".</p>

<p><b>But my camera can do 60/120FPS, so why can't Open Camera?</b> - High frame rates often are achieved only by the
"stock" camera app (or "mods" of it) because these are written for a specific device and don't have to go through
the standard Android camera API. Some devices do now support high speed frame rates when Camera2 API is enabled.</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't Open Camera show 23MP resolution on my Sony Xperia, only 8MP?</b> - This was a problem on older devices
    and/or with the old Camera API because of Sony not making this available to third party camera applications. On newer Sony
    devices, this should become available if you set Settings/"Camera API" to "Camera2 API".</p>

<p><b>Why does the resolution of my photos not match the specified camera resolution?</b> - This happens if
<a href="#auto_stabilise">auto-level</a> is enabled. The image is rotated to be level, which means the
resolution (and aspect-ratio) will change.</p>

<p><b>Why can't I change the ISO?</b> - Even if your device supports ISO, this may not be made available through the
standard Android API for 3rd party camera apps to use.</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't touch to focus work?</b> - Touching the screen should allow you to choose a particular region to focus
on. If this doesn't work:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check the focus mode (under the popup menu), for best results you usually want
    <img src="focus_mode_continuous_picture.png" alt="Continuous focus icon" width="16" height="16">Continuous or
    <img src="focus_mode_auto.png" alt="Continuous focus icon" width="16" height="16">Auto focus modes.</li>
    <li>Check that <a href="#face_detection">Settings/"Face detection"</a> is disabled (focus regions aren't possible in face detection mode).</li>
    <li>Some devices or cameras (especially front cameras) don't support touch to focus.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>I get "FAILED TO OPEN CAMERA"</b> - In some cases this is fixed by restarting
Open Camera, or otherwise make sure nothing else is using the camera (including the
torch being enabled). In some cases a phone gets into a state where the camera can't
be opened, which is fixed by rebooting. If it persists even after restarting your
device, try other camera applications in case the camera is faulty.</p>

<p><b>Why has Open Camera stopped working properly?</b> - If something stops working in Open Camera
first try a reboot of your device. If that doesn't resolve the problem, try resetting
the settings to the defaults (under Settings/Settings manager/"Reset settings"), or try reinstalling
the app (or go to your device's App Settings and select "Clear data" for Open Camera) to
reset it to its initial conditions. Obviously ideally this shouldn't happen, but can be a way of
working around any unresolved bugs that appear. If something stops working in an upgrade to a new
version of Open Camera, and the problem isn't resolved by a reinstall/Clear data, please let me
know, but in the meantime you can install the older versions from
<!-- use &#8203; to limit widths on continuous text to 30 characters, to avoid messing up view on mobile devices -->
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencamera/files/">https://sourceforge.net/&#8203;projects/opencamera/files/</a> .</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't the preview display match the resultant photo/video? One of them is cropped.</b> - Firstly, make
sure that Settings/Camera preview/Preview size is set to "Match photo size (WYSIWYG)". However if that doesn't fix
the problem, this is a limitation on some devices and photo/video resolutions (it happens if the device doesn't offer
a "preview" with the same aspect ratio as the chosen photo/video resolution). A workaround may be to try a different
resolution for photos and/or videos.</p>

<p><b>Why isn't Open Camera available in my language?</b> - I can only speak English I'm afraid. Please contact me
if you're willing to do a translation (this doesn't require any knowledge of Android programming, it's just a case
of translating a set of strings in a text file).</p>

<p><b>Why is the non-English translation of my language incomplete?</b> - Scene modes and color effects aren't
currently translated, as these are just strings returned by the camera. Also note that even if I get someone to
translate Open Camera, when I later add new features/options, this may require additional strings which aren't
translated. I don't have a team of paid translators, so it's not always possible to keep translations up to date :)</p>

<p><b>The non-English translation is wrong!</b> - I can only speak English, and am dependent on other people to
offer translations. If you think a particular translation is inaccurate, please let me know.</p>

<p><b>Why is the screen forced to maximum brightness?</b> - If you don't like this feature, you can switch it off
by going to Settings/On screen GUI/Force maximum brightness.</p>

<p><b>Does Open Camera support selfie sticks / bluetooth remotes?</b> - Open Camera has support for some selfie sticks
though different sticks work in different ways, so it's hard to guarantee this. Sticks and bluetooth remote controls
which work by triggering a volume key press should work (and the behaviour can be configured by
Settings/More camera controls/"Volume keys").</p>

<p><b>Why is auto-level slow?</b> - This feature requires doing a decompress of the JPEG data, followed by a
rotation of a multi-megapixel image, then recompressing, which typically results in a short pause on most devices.
And as devices get faster CPUs, they typically come with cameras with even bigger megapixels! This is why I've made
it optional (and you can set the volume control to quickly switch it on and off if you like).</p>

<p><b>Why is auto-level for photos only?</b> - Doing auto-level for video is a <i>massively</i> harder
problem. This wouldn't be possible in real-time - rotating images causes a noticeable pause as it is, imagine
having to do that for every frame. Also the rotation angle wouldn't be constant, so it's a much harder problem
figuring out what the correct result should actually be.</p>

<p><b>Can I launch a different gallery app when I press the gallery icon? Why doesn't Open Camera
have its own gallery app?</b> - If you have more than one Gallery app on your device, you should be
given the choice which to use when you press the gallery icon. If one app is already set up as the
default and you want to change it, then go to the App Settings for that app, and under
"Launch by default" (or something like that) it will list if it is set as the defaults for any
actions, with an option to clear them. There are plenty of gallery apps for Android, and it seems
better for users to have this choice, rather than Open Camera having its own custom gallery.</p>

<p><b>Clicking on the thumbnail icon only shows the photo briefly?</b> - This can happen if you've changed the save location
for photos/videos to one that is not typical (e.g., not inside DCIM/ ). Some gallery applications will not show a photo in
such cases.</p>

<p><b>Why does Open Camera have ads?</b> - Open Camera does not have ads in the application (there may be ads on the online
webpage you're reading now, but not in the app). There are however some clones on Google Play with ads inserted.
Please ensure that you've downloaded from one of the places listed above
on this page.</p>

<p><b>Does Open Camera support features like manual controls for exposure/ISO/focus, and RAW?</b> -
Set Settings/"Camera API" to "Camera2 API" for such features (if the option isn't there, it's not supported on your device).
This is turned off by default as some <a href="devices.html">devices</a> have poor behaviour.</p>

<p><b>My device has Android 5 or later, why can't I select the Camera2 API?</b> - Some Android 5+ devices only have
"legacy" Camera2 support, which means it isn't any better than the original Camera API. Open Camera doesn't support
enabling Camera2 on such devices.</p>

<p><b>Does Open Camera support HDR+, or use the Pixel's Visual Core?</b> If you have a Google Pixel with Pixel Visual Core, then Open Camera
should be using HDR+ when the following settings are set: Photo Mode Standard, flash off (or auto if the flash doesn't fire),
white balance auto, color effect none, no exposure compensation, no manual ISO/exposure, no RAW. HDR+ should be
supported in both old and Camera2 API. See
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/discussion/general/thread/61950751/">this thread</a> for more discussion.
Note that some Google Pixels (e.g., 3a) do not have a Pixel Visual Core chip, and may not support HDR+ in third party
camera applications (see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/tickets/592/">this thread</a>).</p>

<p><b>Why isn't Panorama supported on my device?</b> - To support panorama in Open Camera, this requires Android 5+,
a gyroscope and compass, and at least 256MB of "large heap" memory (note, this isn't the same as the device's RAM).
Bear in mind that even if your device supports panorama, with Open Camera I have to support thousands of Android devices,
and I don't have the luxury of targetting functionality towards one particular device.</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't Open Camera's HDR images look like other HDR camera apps?</b> - There are a great many different ways
of applying a HDR algorithm, some may do better or worse in different circumstances; some may look more or less pleasing
depending on what you are after. Also note that some camera apps use "HDR" to mean "apply a whacky-looking filter".
Whilst HDR filters can be used to apply a rather unreal or vivid image, for now Open Camera's HDR is more geared towards
capturing the range of exposures.</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't Open Camera's HDR photos look as good as other HDR photos I see?</b> - Firstly, see the previous question.
Beyond that, many HDR photos you see on the Internet may have been manually processed in HDR software that allows the
user to tweak settings for optimal results for a given image. Such photos may have had additional processing done. Open
Camera's HDR algorithm tries to get the best results for most purposes automatically, but isn't going to beat manual
editing.</p>

<p><b>I ran out of space while recording video, and the video is corrupted, how can I get it back?</b> - Firstly, this sadly
isn't an Open Camera bug - it's an issue that the video recording API doesn't stop or report an error when storage
runs out. As a workaround, Open Camera does try to stop videos when storage space is low (although note this workaround
may not be feasible in some cases if saving to non-default locations). In order to recover a file, you can try
"MP4Fix Video Repair Tool" by Smamolot (com.smamolot.mp4fix) (not affiliated with me or Open Camera!).</p>

<p><b>My device ran out of power while recording video, and the video is corrupt! How can I get it back?</b> - This can happen if
the device is very slow at processing the video file after stopping, and this doesn't finishing when the device powers off. Open
Camera will stop the video in advance of the device shutting down to help reduce this risk (see "Critical battery check" option),
but if this still happens, the best hope is to try MP4Fix, see the previous question. Note that if this happens, it isn't an
Open Camera bug - it's a problem that will happen on any device where the device shuts off before the video can be processed.</p>

<p><b>Does Open Camera support external USB cameras?</b> - Unfortunately Open Camera does not support USB cameras. These don't
seem to use the standard Android camera APIs, and it would be a lot of work to add support for these.</p>

<p><b>I don't like the UI!</b> - The UI for Open Camera has improved significantly over the versions (both in terms
of having a consistent look, and the operation), so this criticism seems to have gone down, but there's always room
for improvement! However, in order for me to improve, please be specific: comments like this could mean all sorts of
things, such as the style of the icons, the arrangement of the icons, wanting more things on the main screen, wanting
less things on the main screen, preferring swipes to icons, wanting it easier to change certain options, or even that
some devices may have a bug that I'm not aware of. Also bear in mind that some preferences may be a matter of opinion
and it's not possible to get an app that satisfies everyone (e.g., some camera apps hide everything behind popup menus
that you swipe to enable; others have as much on screen as possible - I try to achieve a balance in Open Camera).</p>

<p><b>Why is the UI cluttered?</b> - Under Settings/"On screen GUI", there are options to disable various controls and
so on from the main view.</p>
