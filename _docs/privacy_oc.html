<p>Open Camera accesses and records camera sensor and microphone data, which is used for the purpose
of taking photos and recording videos, to fulfil its purpose as a camera. Microphone permission is also used for the optional "Audio control" options.</p>

<p>Open Camera requires permission to "access photos, media and files on your devices", as this permission is required for Android to
save resultant photos and videos to your device.</p>

<p>Location permission is required for geotagging options (for photos and videos, including stamp and subtitles options).
    Geotagging is disabled by default, but if enabled, your location is encoded into saved image and video files.
    Location permission is also required to connect to Bluetooth LE remote control devices.</p>

<p>Bluetooth permission is required for communicating with some supported Bluetooth remote control devices.</p>

<p>Since Open Camera also uses operating system APIs, you should review relevant privacy policies
    such as for your device, manufacturer, operating system and/or Google accounts. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The optional voice control option uses the Android
        <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/SpeechRecognizer">speech recognition service</a>.
        When enabled, audio data is likely to be sent to remote servers by Android to perform speech recognition.
    </li>
    <li>The "addresses" option for photo stamp or video subtitles uses the Android
        <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder">Geocoder API</a>.
        When enabled, this requires that your device transmits location data across the Internet to a
        third party (which may depend on what "backend services" are installed on your device).
    </li>
    <li>Apps/services such as cloud services on your device may auto-upload photos and videos that are saved on your device.
    </li>
</ul>
