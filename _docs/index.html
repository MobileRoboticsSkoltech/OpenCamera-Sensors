<p><a name="requirements"></a><b>Requirements</b></p>

<p>This requires Android 4.0 or better. I've tested this successfully on the Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.3, and
the Nexus 6 and Nexus 7 (2013) running Android 5. The auto-stabilise feature may not be available if the app deems
there is not enough memory (RAM) available (technical explanation: requires 128MB of "large heap").</p>

<p>Note that I've had reports of problems on CyanogenMod (CM11) - unfortunately I don't have any CM11 devices to test on,
and CyanogenMod doesn't appear to offer any means of testing without a real device (e.g., no emulator AVD images, no
remote device testing), so I have no way of supporting this.</p>

<p><a name="quickstart"></a><b>Quickstart</b></p>

<p>Simply point, and press the blue camera icon <img src="take_photo.png" alt="Take Photo icon" width="32" height="32"> to take a photo.
The camera will automatically focus before taking the picture. You can also focus at any time by touching on the screen. If
your device supports focus areas, you can touch the part of the screen you want to focus. Touching an area will also
(if your device supports it) control the exposure level (e.g., so clicking on a bright area will adjust the exposure
so that it becomes less bright). To zoom, use the slider next to the take photo button, or do a multi-touch "pinch"
gesture. You can also control via the volume keys on your phone or tablet - by default, pressing them will take a
photo, but you can change this to zoom in/out from the <a href="#settings">Settings</a>.</p>

<p>You can press the gallery icon to view your photos
(by default saved in the OpenCamera folder) - it will show the most recent image or video. The gallery button's
icon will also show a thumbnail for the most recent image/video. Note that there is also an option
in the <a href="#settings">Settings</a> to "Pause after taking photo" - if ticked,
then when you take a photo, the image will be displayed - to keep the photo, touch the screen (or take another photo). To delete it,
press the trash icon <img src="trash.png" alt="Trash icon" width="32" height="32">. To share an image, press the share icon
<img src="share.png" alt="Share icon" width="32" height="32">.</p>

<p>The screen display is kept on when Open Camera is running as the foreground app (if
you want to switch off the display, do so on your device manually).</p>

<p><a name="user_interface"></a><b>On-Screen User Interface</b></p>

<p>A white square is shown (depending on the focus mode), which turns green to indicate that the auto-focus was
successful, or red if it was not.</p>

<p><img src="switch_camera.png" alt="Switch Camera icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch camera</b> - Switches between front and back camera (if your
device has two cameras).</p>

<p><img src="switch_video.png" alt="Switch Video icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Switch to/from video</b> - Switches between taking photo mode, and
recording video mode. When in video mode, the take photo icon will change to the record video icon
<img src="take_video.png" alt="Record Video icon" width="32" height="32">.</p>

<p><img src="exposure.png" alt="Exposure Compensation icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Exposure compensation and ISO</b> - Clicking this will bring
up a slider and plus/minus buttons which can be used to control the exposure compensation. A higher value increases
the exposure, so that pictures come out brighter in low light; a lower value makes pictures darker. One unit of
EV changes the brightness of the captured image by a factor of two. +1 EV doubles the image brightness, while -1
EV halves the image brightness. Set to 0 for the default exposure. To get rid of the slider and buttons, either
click the Exposure button again, or click elsewhere on the screen. See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_compensation">Exposure compensation</a>.
(Only available if the camera supports control of the exposure, and ISO is "auto".) If Camera2 API is used, and
a non-auto ISO mode is selected, then instead clicking this icon will bring up sliders allowing you to control the ISO
setting and (if supported) the exposure time.</p>

<p><img src="exposure_unlocked.png" alt="Lock Exposure icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Exposure lock</b> - Click to lock or unlock the exposure.
When locked, the icon will change to <img src="exposure_locked.png" alt="Exposure Locked icon" width="32" height="32">. Locking the exposure means
the exposure doesn't change based on the brightness of the current scene (though you can still adjust the exposure
compensation). Note that this isn't guaranteed to work on all devices (doesn't seem to work on Galaxy S3, Nexus 6).</p>

<p><img src="popup.png" alt="Popup icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Popop menu</b> - Opens the popup menu for quick access to changing
flash, focus, ISO, white balance, scene mode, color effect, camera/video resolution, timer, burst mode, grid:</p><ul>
<li><b>Flash</b> - Typical options are off, auto, on and torch mode.</li>
<li><b>Focus</b> - Default is "auto" (camera will focus before taking a photo or when you touch to focus). Other options include
infinity and macro. "Focus Locked" mode means focus will only occur when you touch to focus.
If Camera2 API is used, then "Focus Manual" will display an on-screen slider, allowing
you to directly control the focus distance.
Lastly, continuous focus mode means that the camera will continually focus - this option is generally best for taking photos as
quickly as possible.</li>
<li><b>ISO</b> - A higher ISO setting means the camera is more sensitive to light, though may also
result in more noise. This mimics the film speed on traditional film cameras. Note that this
setting may not be supported on all cameras. See
<a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings">here</a> for more details on ISO.
If Camera2 API is used, then if a non-auto ISO is used, then selecting the exposure compensation icon
<img src="exposure.png" alt="Exposure Compensation icon" width="32" height="32"> will bring up sliders allowing direct control over the ISO and exposure
time.</li>
<li><b>White balance</b> - Choose a method to control how the white balance is set. See
<a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance">here</a> for an
explanation of white balance. (Only available if the camera supports different white balance
settings.)</li>
<li><b>Scene mode</b> - Choose a scene mode to apply. (Only available if the camera supports scene
modes.)</li>
<li><b>Color effect</b> - Choose a color effect to apply. (Only available if the camera supports
color effects.)</li>
<li><b>Auto-stabilise</b> - Enable the auto-stabilise features for photos (see
<a href="#auto_stabilise">below</a>). (Only available if the device has enough memory.)</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="#settings">Settings</a> for more info on the other settings.</p>

<p><b>Gallery</b> - Click to launch the Gallery app, to view the most recent
photo/video (by default saved in the OpenCamera folder). If you get the message "No Gallery app available", then you should install
a Gallery app (e.g., <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moblynx.galleryics">Gallery ICS</a>).
You can also "long press" on the Gallery icon - this will let you switch between the recent save locations (if not using Storage Access
Framework), or take you straight to a file dialog to choose a save location if additional locations have yet been defined. See
<a href="#save_location">Save location</a> under Settings/More camera controls for more details.</p>

<p><img src="settings.png" alt="Settings icon" width="32" height="32"><b>Settings</b> - Click to open the <a href="#settings">Settings</a>. (If your phone/tablet
has a hardware menu button, pressing that should also open the settings.)</p>

<p>The on-screen display also shows the remaining battery left (green/red status bar in the corner), and optionally
the zoom level (if zoomed in), the remaining free storage space on the device, and the current angle orientation
of the camera. If "Store location data" is enabled (off by default), then a small "earth" icon
<img src="earth.png" alt="Earth GPS icon" width="24" height="24"> will appear next to
the battery indicator when the location is available (you can still take photos when the earth icon doesn't show,
it's just that location data won't be stored in the photo). A dot shows to the top-right of the earth icon to
indicate the accuracy (green for accurate, yellow for less accurate). If the location isn't available, a red dash will be shown through the earth icon.</p>

<p><a name="auto_stabilise"></a><b>Auto-stabilise feature</b></p>

<p>All Android cameras will rotate the photo depending on the orientation of the camera, but only to the nearest 90 degrees - so the
photos look right whether you hold the device in "portrait" or "landscape" mode. But Open Camera has the option to rotate the
photos so they are perfectly level, so your shots come out looking perfectly level every time!</p>

<p><a href="auto_stabilise_image_20131009.jpg">
<img src="auto_stabilise_image_20131009.jpg" style="max-width:100%" alt="Screenshots demonstrating auto-stabilise" title="Screenshots demonstrating auto-stabilise">
</a></p>

<p>The above shows a rather exaggerated example - in practice, you can probably take better photos, but this feature ensures they
come out perfectly level, without you having to edit them afterwards in a photo editor. Of course you won't always want this -
perhaps you're going for artistic 45-degree shots - so this is an option. By default it is disabled.  To enable, go to the
<a href="#settings">Settings</a>, and enable "Auto-stabilise". Note that this feature is memory intensive - it will not be available
on devices with low memory. Even where it is available, the performance of taking photos will be
slower, and there is a risk it may cause the app to fail on devices I haven't been able
to test. If you do have problems, you'll have to disable the feature again.</p>

<p>Also note that the feature reduces the available space in the image - because rotating an image makes it no longer fit into a
rectangular image, so we have to crop it. So it's still advisable to try to hold the camera reasonably level when using this
feature.</p>

<p><a name="settings"></a><b>Settings</b></p>

<p><b>Camera Effects:</b></p>

<!--<p><b>Apply a color effect</b> - Choose a color effect to apply. (Only available if the camera supports color effects.)</p>

<p><b>Apply a scene mode</b> - Choose a scene mode to apply. (Only available if the camera supports scene modes.)</p>

<p><b>Set the white balance</b> - Choose a method to control how the white balance is set. See
<a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance">here</a> for an explanation of white balance. (Only
available if the camera supports different white balance settings.)</p>-->

<!--<p><b>Set the exposure compensation</b> - A higher value increases the exposure,
so that pictures come out brighter in low light; a lower value makes pictures
darker. Set to 0 for the default exposure. See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_compensation">Exposure compensation</a>.
(Only available if the camera supports control of the exposure.)</p>-->

<!--<p><b>Set the ISO</b> - A higher ISO setting means the camera is more sensitive to light, though may also result in more
noise. This mimics the film speed on traditional film cameras. Note that this setting may not be supported on all cameras.
See <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings">here</a> for more details on ISO.</p>

<p><b>Auto-stabilise</b> - Enable the auto-stabilise features for photos (see <a href="#auto_stabilise">above</a>). (Only available
if the device has enough memory.)</p>-->

<p><b>Lock photo/video orientation</b> - Normally the orientation of the photo/video will be rotated by some multiple of
90 degree such that the orientation looks right - e.g. if your device is held in portrait, the resultant image/video will
be in portrait. This option allows fixing the camera to either be in portrait or landscape. Note that if auto-stabilise
is also enabled, it will have the effect of aligning photos to the nearest 90 degrees.</p>

<p><b>Face detection</b> - If this is enabled, then the camera will automatically try to detect faces, and use
them for the focus, metering (exposure) and white balance. Faces will be drawn as yellow squares when detected.
Note that if this option is enabled, then you will not be able to touch to manually select the focus area, and
the white balance option will have no effect (since the face recognition will be used to determine these).</p>

<p><b>Camera Controls:</b></p>

<p><b>Timer</b> - Set a timer for taking photos or recording video. Press the take photo/video button again to
cancel the timer.</p>

<p><b>Burst mode</b> - Take a repeated set of photos when the take photo button is pressed. Press the take photo
button again to cancel.</p>

<p><b>Burst mode interval</b> - Specify the delay (if any) between photos in burst mode. Note that true burst mode
isn't yet supported, so if no delay is selected, there will still be a short delay. The actual speed that the photos
are taken at will depend on the performance of your device's camera. If a delay is selected, note that this does not
include the time taken to auto-focus and take each photo.</p>

<p><b>More camera controls...</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Touch to capture</b> - This option allows you to take a photo either just by touching or double-tapping on the
preview screen. Note that starting/stopping video recording is still performed in the normal way; this option only
affects taking photos.</p>

<p><b>Pause after taking photo</b> - If ticked, after taking a photo the display will pause, with options to share or delete the
photo. To keep the photo and continue, touch the screen (or take another photo).</p>

<p><b>Shutter sound</b> - Whether to play a sound after taking a photo. (Requires Android 4.2 or higher to disable, and even
then isn't supported on all devices.)</p>

<p><b>Timer beep</b> - Whether to beep when the timer is counting down, or for the burst mode delay (see below).</p>

<p><b>Voice timer countdown</b> - Whether to give a voice countdown when the timer is counting down, or for the burst mode
delay (see below).</p>

<p><b>Volume keys</b> - You can set what happens when the volume keys are pressed: either take photo/video,
focus (trigger an autofocus - or if in manual mode, change the focus distance in/out), zoom in/out, change
the exposure compensation (or if in manual ISO mode and using Camera2 API, change the ISO), switch
auto-stabilise on/off, just change the device's volume as normal, or do nothing.</p>

<p><b>Audio control options</b> - If enabled, this allows taking a photo (or starting video recording, depending on the mode)
by making a noise. An on-screen microphone button <img src="ic_mic_white_48dp.png" alt="Microphone icon" width="32" height="32"> will appear, to
start/stop listening. The "loud noise" option will listen for any noise (so you can remotely take a photo by saying "cheese",
whistling, or whatever you prefer). Note that leaving the listening turned on may use additional battery. The "voice command" option
listens specifically for saying "cheese" - so this has the advantage that it's less likely to be triggered unintentionally, but
the downside is that in voice command mode, listening is limited to only a few seconds (this is a restriction of speech recognition
in Android apps). Note that this can't be used to stop video recording - if you want to have some remote control on video recording,
see the "Max duration of video" option.</p>

<p><b>Audio control sensitivity</b> - This controls how sensitive Open Camera is to noises, if "Audio control" is set to "Loud noise".
If you find it's taking photos too often unintentionally, or isn't responding to your sounds, try adjusting this option.</p>

<p><a name="save_location"></a><b>Save location</b> - Select the folder to store the photos in. Click on a folder
(or "Parent Folder") to navigate through the filesystem. Select "New Folder" to create a new folder in the currently
displayed folder. Select "Use Folder" to choose the currently displayed folder. Note that on Android, there are some
folders that cannot be written to - Open Camera will display a message if you try to use one of these folders. Once
you have specified a new save location, you can long press on the Gallery icon to quickly switch between recent save
locations. Note that if "Use Storage Access Framework" is selected, this option will instead show up Android's standard
file chooser - navigate to the desired folder, and click "SELECT". If you want to save to an SD card, see "How can I
save to my external SD card?" under the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p><b>Use Storage Access Framework</b> - If selected, Open Camera will instead use Android's
<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.html">Storage Access Framework</a>. This
has some advantages, such as using the standard Android file picker, and being the only way to save to SD cards on Android 5
- though it may be slightly slower to take photos. (Requires Android 5.0 or higher.)</p>

<!--Enter the folder to store the photos in. This can be either a relative path (e.g.,
OpenCamera or even something like MyPics/Camera) in which case the folder will be located inside the "DCIM"
folder (usually something like /sdcard/DCIM/ ). For more advanced users, if the folder name starts with "/", then
it indicates the full absolute path (e.g., /sdcard/Pictures/Photos ). Note that folder names are case sensitive.
OpenCamera will attempt to create the folder (and any sub-folders as required) if it doesn't exist. If you specify
a path that you don't have write permissions for, then OpenCamera will fail to save images/videos (and this will
be reported when you try to take a photo or video).-
You can also use this option to save to an external SD card, though unfortunately the path varies depending on the
device, so you'll have to look this up yourself (it's usually something inside /mnt/ - a file explorer app such as
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop">ES File Explorer</a> may help).-->

<p><b>Save photo prefix</b> - This option allows you to customise save filenames for photos.</p>

<p><b>Save video prefix</b> - This option allows you to customise save filenames for videos.</p>

<p><b>Show camera when locked</b> - If you have a lock screen on your device (e.g., PIN to unlock), Open Camera by
default will show above the lock screen - i.e., if locked, you won't have to enter the PIN to use Open Camera. The
device still needs to be unlocked in order to go to the Settings or Gallery. If you would prefer Open Camera to always
be unavailable when your device is locked, you can disable this option.</p>

<p><b>Perform auto-focus on startup</b> - Whether Open Camera should auto-focus when starting the camera. Some devices
have a bug where the flash turns on when this happens, so a workaround is to disable this option.</p>

<p><b>On screen GUI...</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Preview size</b> - By default, Open Camera matches the aspect ratio of the preview (the image that is
displayed on the phone/tablet's display) with that of the photo resolution ("Match photo size (WYSIWYG)" mode). The
advantage is that what you see in the preview will match what will be in the resultant photo
("What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get") - though this may mean you will have "black bars" on the display in order to do
this. If instead you select "Maximise preview size", then the camera preview will be as large as possible, trying to
fill the available space. However if the resolution of the photo is a different aspect ratio to that of your device,
this will result in the preview being cropped. In video mode, the preview is always in WYSIWYG mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that Android 4.4.3 <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=70830">introduced a bug</a>
which means that the aspect ratio will be wrong if you select "Maximise preview size" (i.e., the preview will look
squished). To avoid this problem, stick with "Match photo size".</li>
<li>Also note that even in "Match photo size" mode, on some devices and resolutions, it may not be possible to match
the preview to the resultant photo/video exactly; in such cases, Open Camera will try to match as closely as
possible.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>UI placement</b> - Whether to optimise the user interface for left-handed or right-handed use.</p>

<p><b>Immersive mode</b> - Allows you to choose between various modes which affect the behaviour of the user-interface, in order to
make it more immersive (requires Android 4.4 or higher):</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Off</b> - Don't use Android's immersive mode, and on-screen virtual navigation buttons are always visible.</li>
<li><b>Only hide on-screen virtual navigation buttons (default)</b> - Don't use Android's immersive mode, but on-screen virtual
navigation buttons are dimmed.</li>
<li><b>Hide GUI</b> - After a short delay, any on-screen virtual navigation buttons will disappear, along with most of the GUI buttons.
To exit this immersive mode, either touch on-screen, or swipe in from the top/bottom sides when the device is held in landscape (or
left/right sides if held in portrait).</li>
<li><b>Hide everything</b> - Same as "Hide GUI", but when in immersive mode everything will disappear except the camera preview. This
mode probably isn't useful for most people (since you need to exit immersive mode even to take a photo), but is available if you wish
to only have the preview showing.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Show zoom</b> - Whether to display the current zoom level of the camera (when zoomed in).</p>

<p><b>Show zoom -/+ controls</b> - Whether to display -/+ buttons to control zoom.</p>

<p><b>Show zoom slider controls</b> - Whether to display to a slider to control zoom.</p>

<p><b>Show ISO</b> - If selected, the current ISO, exposure time and frame rate (FPS) will be displayed (only available if Camera2 API is used).</p>

<p><b>Show free memory</b> - Whether to display the remaining storage space of the device.</p>

<p><b>Show angle</b> - Whether to display the orientation angle of the device's camera.</p>

<p><b>Show angle line</b> - Whether to display a horizontal "level" line that visually indicates the orientation of the device.</p>

<p><b>Angle highlight color</b> - This controls the color to be used for the angle display and "level" line when the camera is nearly
level.</p>

<p><b>Show compass direction</b> - Whether to display the compass direction of the device's camera.</p>

<p><b>Show time</b> - Whether to display the current time.</p>

<p><b>Show battery</b> - Whether to display the current battery level.</p>

<p><b>Show a grid</b> - Whether to display one of a choice of grids on the camera preview. Grids are useful in photography to help
compose your image. Options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>3x3 - helps with applying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">rule of thirds</a>.</li>
<li>Phi 3x3 - 3x3 grid with ratios 1:0.618:1.</li>
<li>4x2</li>
<li>Crosshair</li>
<li>Golden - displays a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_spiral">Golden spiral</a> (or technically,
a Fibonacci spiral). You can <a href="http://www.apogeephoto.com/may2014/how-to-use-the-golden-ratio-to-improve-your-photography.shtml">use
this to improve your photography</a>.</li>
<li>Golden Triangles</li>
<li>Diagonals</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Show a crop guide</b> - A crop guide is a rectangle displayed on-screen, which has the specified aspect ratio
(if different to the photo/video aspect ratio). This is useful if you plan to crop the resultant photos or videos
to a particular aspect ratio. For photos, the crop-guide requires "Preview size" to be set to WYSIWYG mode.</p>

<p><b>Show "toast" messages</b> - Whether to display "toasts" (these are the popup messages that appear with information).</p>

<p><b>Show thumbnail animation</b> - Whether to display the moving thumbnail animation when taking a photo.</p>

<p><b>Show border when taking photo</b> - Whether to display a border effect when taking a photo.</p>

<p><b>Keep display on</b> - Whether to force keeping the screen display on, while the main Open Camera UI is active.</p>

<p><b>Force maximum brightness</b> - Whether to force the screen display to maximum brightness.</p>

<p><b>Rotate preview</b> - this option rotates the on-screen preview by 180 degrees. Most users won't ever need this,
but this option can be useful if you are using Open Camera with equipment which inverts the image. Note that this
doesn't rotate the resultant photos/videos - you'll still have to rotate those yourself afterwards - but this will
correct the preview so that you can still see what you are shooting properly.</p>

<p><b>Photo and Video Settings:</b></p>

<p><b>Photo settings</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Camera resolution</b> - Select the resolution of photo images taken by the camera. Note that if auto-stabilise is enabled,
images will in general come out as a slightly lower resolution (due to the rotation and cropping that's required).</p>

<p><b>Image quality</b> - The image quality of saved JPEG images. Higher means better quality, but the image files will take up
more storage space.</p>

<p><b>Stamp photos</b> - Option to add a date and timestamp to the resultant photos. If "Store
location data" is enabled (see "Location settings" below), then the current location latitude
and longitude coordinates will also be stamped on the resultant photos (if the location is known).
Similarly for "Store compass direction". Note that if this option is enabled, then it will take
longer to save the photo. Also note that this option is only supported for photos, not video.</p>

<p><b>Datestamp format, Timestamp format</b> - If "Stamp photos" is enabled, these options allow
extra control over the date and time formatting.</p>

<p><b>GPS stamp format</b> - If "Stamp photos" is enabled, this allows extra control over the GPS
formatting.</p>

<p><b>Custom text</b> - Here you can enter some text to be stamped onto resultant photos (e.g.,
this could be used for a copyright image). Note that if this option is enabled, then it will take
longer to save the photo. Also note that this option is only supported for photos, not video.</p>

<p><b>Font size</b> - Sets the font size used for text for options "Stamp photos" or
"Custom text".</p>

<p><b>Font color</b> - Sets the font color used for text for options "Stamp photos" or
"Custom text".</p>

<p><b>Text style</b> - Whether to render the text on the image with a shadow background effect, for
options "Stamp photos" or "Custom text".</p>

<p><b>Video settings</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Video resolution</b> - Select the resolution of videos taken by the camera.</p>

<p><b>Force 4K UHD video (experimental)</b> - Enable recording in 4K UHD (3840x2160) on the back camera (if ticked, this overrides the setting in
"Video resolution"). This is provided for some phones that don't properly expose their 4K video resolution to 3rd party camera apps
(and so 4K resolution doesn't show in the Video resolution option above).
It turns out that some such devices can be made to record in 4K resolution if it's requested, but on other devices this won't work.
If you enable this on a device that doesn't support it, you may either get an error
message when you try to record, or it may succeed but create a video where the resolution isn't 4K, or may even result in a crash! So
please test this out first. I've tested this successfully on a Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 3, but even there it only works on some
variants of those devices. If this doesn't work, it isn't a bug in Open Camera, it's because your device doesn't support 4K recording
for third party camera apps. (If this option doesn't show up at all, it's either because your device already lists 4K in the Video
resolutions options above, or because Open Camera thinks this is a device that probably doesn't support 4K video.)</p>

<p><b>Enable video stabilization</b> - Video stabilization reduces the shaking due to the motion of the camera in
both the preview and in recorded videos.</p>

<p><b>Video bitrate (approx)</b> - If set to a value other than "default", the default video bitrate is overridden. Higher values mean better
quality video, but the files take up more disk space. Note that some values may be unsupported by your device, and may
cause the recording to fail - in some cases, this can cause problems with the camera that require a reboot to fix. So
please test before using. Also note that the bitrate setting is approximate - the resultant video file will typically be slightly different
to that requested.</p>

<p><b>Video frame rate (approx)</b> - If set to a value other than "default", the camera will try to match this frame
rate. Note that this is very approximate, as frame rate depends on many factors such as your device and lighting
conditions, so there is no guarantee that the resultant video's frame rate will match with the requested value. Also note
that some frame rate values may be unsupported by your device, and cause the recording to fail, so please test before
using.</p>

<p><b>Max duration of video</b> - This option can be used to set a maximum duration of the video. If set, video recording
will stop after the specified time (unless already stopped earlier).</p>

<p><b>Restart video after max duration</b> - If a max duration has been set (see above), this option can be used to make
the video automatically stop and restart the specified number of times. So this can be used to take a video for a long
period, broken up into multiple video files. If a max duration has not been set, then this option has no effect.</p>

<p><b>Maximum file size of video</b> - This allows to set a maximum file size for videos. Note that almost all Android devices
set a maximum file size (typically around 2GB or 4GB), and there is no way Open Camera can work around such a limitation (and
using exFAT doesn't get round it). But this option allows you to set a smaller value. Note that the value is approximate - typically
the resultant videos may be slightly smaller. Note that if you using this option together
with "Max duration of video", then - if "Restart on maximum file size" is enabled - hitting the maximum file size will cause a
restart that doesn't reset the max duration timer, nor does it count as one of the number of restarts. E.g., if you requested a
maximum duration of 30m, with 1 restart, but the video hits the maximum file size after 20m, rather than getting two times 30m
videos, you'd get four videos, of lengths 20m, 10m, 20m, 10m (i.e., the 30m videos are split at the maximum file sizes). If
"Restart on maximum file size" is disabled, then hitting the maximum file size will always cause the video to end without
restarting, even if you've set "Restart video after max duration".</p>

<p><b>Restart on maximum file size</b> - Whether to automatically restart if the maximum file size is met. As noted above, almost all
Android devices have a maximum file size for videos, even if you don't explicitly set one. So it's advisable to keep this option to true,
so that Open Camera will restart as soon as possible if you're recording video, and hit this limit. Note that there will still be a loss
of a few seconds while the video stops and restarts - but this at least is better than stopping altogether (and is especially useful if
you want to leave Open Camera recording without you keeping watch).</p>

<p><b>Record audio</b> - Whether to record audio when recording a video.</p>

<p><b>Audio source</b> - Select the audio source for recording video. The effect of this depends on your device -
if it supports an external microphone, you may be able to use this by selecting "External mic". The other options may
provide different settings affecting the resultant audio (e.g., automatic gain control), though this behaviour is
device specific.</p>

<p><b>Audio channels</b> - If recording audio with video, this option allows you to specify mono or stereo recording.
Note that most devices do not support stereo recording. Even for devices that do support this, you may need to modify
the "Audio source" option to another value for this to work.</p>

<p><b>Lock screen when recording video</b> - if enabled, the GUI will be locked when recording video (i.e., the GUI
won't respond to touch presses). You can use this to prevent accidental presses that might change settings or stop
recording. To unlock the GUI, swipe the screen (in any direction). Note that this won't prevent the video being
stopped if you press your device's Home, Recent Apps or Power button (it is not possible for apps to override the
behaviour of these buttons).</p>

<p><b>Flash while recording video</b> - If enabled, the camera flash will flash every second while recording video. This
isn't something most people will need, but it can be useful if the phone is being operated remotely, as a signal that the
video is still recording.</p>

<p><b>Location settings</b> - Select to access the following controls:</p>

<p><b>Store location data (Geotagging)</b> - If selected, then photos will be tagged with the current
location. Location data will also be stored in videos (though only for devices that record in MPEG4 or
3GPP formats).</p>

<p><b>Store compass direction</b> - If selected, then photos will be tagged with the compass direction.
Not supported for videos.</p>

<p><b>Require location data</b> - If "Store location data" is enabled, then also enabling this option means that
photos and videos can only be taken if location data is present (this can be useful if you need pictures/videos to
have location data in them).</p>

<p><b>Use Camera2 API</b> - If selected, this enables support for the Camera2 API that was introduced
in Android 5. This enables some new features, but is currently experimental. Note that not all Android 5
devices have full support for the Camera2 API (Open Camera will only show this option if all cameras
report either "LIMITED" or "FULL" support for the API; "LEGACY" devices are not supported). Supported devices
include the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Known issues with the Camera2 API include bugs with flash (sometimes shots come
out too bright or dark, or auto-exposure routine stops - I've seen this on the Nexus 6 with other camera apps
using Camera2 API), problems with focusing in some cases, and a problem that ISO doesn't always work properly
for recording video. Turning this option on or off will cause Open Camera to restart. (Requires Android 5.0 or higher.)</p>

<p><b>About</b> - Provides various debug information about the app and your device's camera. You can also copy
this information to the clipboard.</p>

<p><b>Reset settings</b> - Resets all Open Camera settings to their default. Selecting this option will cause
Open Camera to restart.</p>

<p><a name="widgets"></a><b>Widgets</b></p>

<p>Open Camera comes with a "Take Photo" widget. You can place this on your homescreen. When clicked
on, it lauches Open Camera and takes a photo immediately.</p>

<p>Open Camera also comes with two widgets that can be
<a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/2781801">displayed on the lock screen</a>
(requires Android 4.2 or later - but lock screen widgets are no longer available in Android 5 or later).
The "Open Camera" widget launches the app; the "Take Photo" widget will also automatically take
a photo. Note that if you have a PIN lock etc, you'll have to unlock even if "Show camera when locked"
is enabled.</p>

<p><a name="faq"></a><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>

<p><b>How can I save to my external SD card?</b> - This depends on your Android version:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Android 4.3 or below</b> - Select <a href="#save_location">Save location</a> under Settings/"More
camera controls", and navigate to a folder on your SD card. Unfortunately the path varies depending on
the device, so you'll have to look this up or find it out yourself - it's usually one of the folders
inside /mnt/ (press "Parent Folder" until you're in "/", then select "mnt", then have a look inside one
of the folders in there - note that confusingly it won't be "sdcard", but will be named something else,
e.g., "extSdCard").</li>
<li><b>Android 4.4</b> - Unfortunately it is not possible for 3rd party apps to write to external SD cards.
<b>This is not a bug or missing feature in Open Camera</b>, rather that 
<a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/02/17/external-blues-google-has-brought-big-changes-to-sd-cards-in-kitkat-and-even-samsung-may-be-implementing-them/">Google
have blocked write access to external SD cards in Android 4.4</a>.</li>
<li><b>Android 5.0 onwards</b> - The restrictions on SD cards introduced in Android 4.4 still apply, however
instead you can enable "Settings/More camera controls/"Use Storage Access Framework", and this should allow you
to save to external SD cards. If when choosing a folder, you only see "Recent", you may need to click on the
three dots at the top right to open the menu, to enable showing the drives (e.g., "Show internal storage", and
hopefully you'll see something similar for the SD card).</li>
<li><b>Android 6.0</b> - On Android 6, some devices support "Adoptable Storage" allowing you to
<a href="http://www.idigitaltimes.com/android-m-update-will-include-native-micro-sd-support-445463">select to use
an SD card as internal storage</a>. Note that not all devices support this, even if running Android 6. If your device
doesn't support this, or you want to instead use an SD card as "portable storage", you'll have to use
the Storage Access Framework method as with Android 5.</li>
</ul>

<!--<p><b>But I have Android 5 (Lollipop), wasn't this supposed to fix saving to SD cards?</b> - Android 5 Lollipop does
<i>not</i> revert the restrictions introduced by Google in Android 4.4. It does introduce a new API for saving to SD
cards and I am looking into this. Note that (a) this requires rewriting portions of the code, it isn't a simple
fix, and (b) this new API is unfortunately not compatible with some of Google/Android's own APIs (e.g., for Exif
reading/writing), so full support for SD cards doesn't seem possible until Google themselves fix this situation.</p>-->

<p><b>Why is taking photos slow compared to other cameras?</b> - If this seems to be the case,
one possibility is due to focusing before taking photos; some
cameras use continuous focus mode which gives faster picture taking. Open Camera supports continuous focus mode, just select
the popup menu and choose the "C" icon
<img src="focus_mode_continuous_picture.png" alt="Continuous Picture focus icon" width="32" height="32">.
Other reasons may be if some options are set (such as auto-stabilise, or "Stamp photos"), these will result in slower photo
times.</p>

<p><b>My pictures are being rotated/cropped!</b> - This likely means the <a href="#auto_stabilise">auto-stabilise</a>
option is on. It's off by default, but you may have accidentally switched it on. To turn off, go to the "popup" menu
and untick Auto-stabilise.</p>

<p><b>My device can do 4K/UHD, so why doesn't it work on Open Camera?</b> - Unfortunately many devices with 4K support
have for some reason not exposed this through the Android API to 3rd party camera apps. If the "Force 4K" option
doesn't work, it's not a bug in Open Camera, it's something that's just not possible through
3rd party apps on some devices. If you want a device with proper support for 4K video recording, get a Nexus 6.</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't the FPS/bitrate setting for video work?</b> - These settings only give "recommendations" to the
camera, and there is no guarantee that they will be met. Some devices might not even allow recording at some
settings, and there's no way to determine this in advance.</p>

<p><b>But my camera can do 60/120FPS, so why can't Open Camera?</b> - High frame rates often are achieved only by the
"stock" camera app (or "mods" of it) because these are written for a specific device and don't have to go through
the standard Android camera API.</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't Open Camera show 23MP resolution on my Sony Xperia, only 8MP?</b> - This is because
<a href="http://talk.sonymobile.com/t5/Xperia-Z5-Z5-Compact-Z5-Premium/Full-camera-res-in-third-party-apps/td-p/1045437/highlight/true/page/4">Sony
have restricted the maximum resolution to 8MP for third party apps</a>.</p>

<p><b>Why does the resolution of my photos not match the specified camera resolution?</b> - This happens if
<a href="#auto_stabilise">auto-stabilise</a> is enabled. The image is rotated to be level, which means the
resolution (and aspect-ratio) will change.</p>

<p><b>Why can't I change the ISO?</b> - Even if your device supports ISO, this may not be made available through the
standard Android API for 3rd party camera apps to use. For example,
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19759068/xperia-z1-camera-parameters-iso-values">this is true of Sony
devices</a>.</p>

<p><b>Why has Open Camera stopped working properly?</b> - If something stops working in Open Camera
first try a reboot of your device. If that doesn't resolve the problem, try resetting
the settings to the defaults (under Settings/"Reset settings"), or try reinstalling
the app (or go to your device's App Settings and select "Clear data" for Open Camera) to
reset it to its initial conditions. Obviously ideally this shouldn't happen, but can be a way of
working around any unresolved bugs that appear. If something stops working in an upgrade to a new
version of Open Camera, and the problem isn't resolved by a reinstall/Clear data, please let me
know, but in the meantime you can install the older versions from
<!-- use &#8203; to limit widths on continuous text to 30 characters, to avoid messing up view on mobile devices -->
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencamera/files/">https://sourceforge.net/&#8203;projects/opencamera/files/</a> .</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't the preview display match the resultant photo/video? One of them is cropped.</b> - Firstly, make
sure that Settings/On screen GUI/Preview size is set to "Match photo size (WYSIWYG)". However if that doesn't fix
the problem, this is a limitation on some devices and photo/video resolutions (it happens if the device doesn't offer
a "preview" with the same aspect ratio as the chosen photo/video resolution). A workaround may be to try a different
resolution for photos and/or videos.</p>

<p><b>Why isn't Open Camera available in my language?</b> - I can only speak English I'm afraid. Please contact me
if you're willing to do a translation (this doesn't require any knowledge of Android programming, it's just a case
of translating a set of strings in a text file).</p>

<p><b>Why is the non-English translation of my language incomplete?</b> - Scene modes and color effects aren't
currently translated, as these are just strings returned by the camera. Also note that even if I get someone to
translate Open Camera, when I later add new features/options, this may require additional strings which aren't
translated. I don't have a team of paid translators, so it's not always possible to keep translations up to date :)</p>

<p><b>The non-English translation is wrong!</b> - I can only speak English, and am dependent on other people to
offer translations. If you think a particular translation is inaccurate, please let me know.</p>

<p><b>Why is the screen forced to maximum brightness?</b> - If you don't like this feature, you can switch it off
by going to Settings/On screen GUI/Force maximum brightness.</p>

<p><b>Why is auto-stabilise slow?</b> - This feature requires doing a decompress of the JPEG data, followed by a
rotation of a multi-megapixel image, then recompressing, which typically results in a short pause on most devices.
And as devices get faster CPUs, they typically come with cameras with even bigger megapixels! This is why I've made
it optional (and you can set the volume control to quickly switch it on and off if you like).</p>

<p><b>Why is auto-stabilise for photos only?</b> - Doing auto-stabilise for video is a <i>massively</i> harder
problem. This wouldn't be possible in real-time - rotating images causes a noticeable pause as it is, imagine
having to do that for every frame. Also the rotation angle wouldn't be constant, so it's a much harder problem
figuring out what the correct result should actually be.</p>

<p><b>Can I launch a different gallery app when I press the gallery icon? Why doesn't Open Camera
have its own gallery app?</b> - If you have more than one Gallery app on your device, you should be
given the choice which to use when you press the gallery icon. If one app is already set up as the
default and you want to change it, then go to the App Settings for that app, and under
"Launch by default" (or something like that) it will list if it is set as the defaults for any
actions, with an option to clear them. There are plenty of gallery apps for Android, and it seems
better for users to have this choice, rather than Open Camera having its own custom gallery.</p>

<p><b>Can you implement disabling shutter sound for earlier than Android 4.2?</b> - The functionality
for this requires Android 4.2. There are possible workarounds for earlier versions, though the issue is
it doesn't work on all devices (either they don't support it, or even that some countries have legal
requirement that camera devices play a sound). At least with the Android 4.2+ method, Open Camera knows
if it isn't supported, and then doesn't show the option. Also I feel for the long term, it's better to
focus on new features, even if they require newer Android versions.</p>

<p><b>Why does Open Camera have ads?</b> - Open Camera does <i>not</i> have ads (there may be ads on the online
webpage you're reading now, but not in the app). There are however some clones on Google Play with ads inserted.
Please ensure that you've downloaded from one of the places listed above
on this page.</p>

<p><b>My device has Android 5, why can't I select the Camera2 API?</b> - Only some Android 5 devices support the new
Camera2 API, such as the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6.</p>

<p><b>I don't like the UI!</b> - The UI for Open Camera has improved significantly over the versions (both in terms
of having a consistent look, and the operation), so this criticism seems to have gone down, but there's always room
for improvement! However, in order for me to improve, please be specific: comments like this could mean all sorts of
things, such as the style of the icons, the arrangement of the icons, wanting more things on the main screen, wanting
less things on the main screen, preferring swipes to icons, wanting it easier to change certain options, or even that
some devices may have a bug that I'm not aware of. Also bear in mind that some preferences may be a matter of opinion
and it's not possible to get an app that satisfies everyone (e.g., some camera apps hide everything behind popup menus
that you swipe to enable; others have as much on screen as possible - I try to achieve a balance in Open Camera).</p>

<p><b>Why is the UI cluttered?</b> - Under Settings/On screen GUI, there are options to disable various controls and
so on from the main view.</p>

<p><b>Can I use the Open Camera source code in my app?</b> - Open Camera is available under the GPL (see
<a href="#licence">Licence</a>), and can be used for free, including commercially, if you follow the terms of that
licence (this means making the source of your app available under a GPL-compatible licence). If you would like to
use the Open Camera in a closed source app, please contact me for a closed source commercial licence, with details
on your company and app.</p>

<p>If you have a question or what seems to be a bug, please first read <a href="#faq">FAQ</a>. Also if something

Version 1.30 (Work in progress)

FIXED   Crash in 1.29 on some devices on startup.
FIXED   Focus/metering regions and face detection now works properly with
        Camera2 when zoomed.
FIXED   Audio control icon still showed if audio control was disaled, when
        previously set to "loud noise" option.
UPDATED Popup menu now uses the more standard three dots icon.
UPDATED Popup menu also shows indicator for flash being off.
UPDATED Show zoom seekbar closer to the edge of screen if -/+ controls not
        enabled; always show manual focus distance seekbar closer to the edge.

Version 1.29 (2016/05/06)

FIXED   Still show Camera2 API option for Android N's LEVEL_3 hardware level.
FIXED   Problems with flash mode on Camera2 API - now seems to be working
        better on my Nexus 6 at least...
FIXED   Sluggish zooming with Camera2 API.
FIXED   With Camera2 API, if starting up with flash auto or on, and in focus
        modes other than auto, macro or locked, then flash wouldn't fire.
FIXED   Problems on some devices where we claimed failed to take photo, even
        though it had succeed (some Samsung devices call the autofocus callback
        more than once).
FIXED   Video recording icon would get stuck on red ("playing") if failed to
        save video file.
FIXED   Too long string for 3x3 grid for French translation on popup menu.
ADDED   Proper support for continuous focus mode for photo mode.
ADDED   Graphical border effect when taking a photo (if you don't like this,
        you can disable it under Settings/On screen GUI/"Show border when
        taking photo").
ADDED   Animation effect for auto-focus square.
UPDATED Improved on-screen graphics (line drawings now have proper
        density-independent thickness rather than being hairline).
UPDATED On-screen ISO display (for Camera2) simplified and moved to top of
        screen.
UPDATED Use Switches instead of Checkboxes in Settings where appropriate.
UPDATED Content description for "switch photo/video mode" button now updates to
        indicate whether it will switch to photo or video mode. Content
        description for "switch camera" button now updates to indicate whether
        it will switch to the front or back camera.
UPDATED Improved content descriptions for buttons on popup menu (focus/flash
        buttons now say which mode they are).
UPDATED Disabled flash options for manual ISO mode in Camera2 API (doesn't work
        properly; plus flash is less useful when setting ISO manually anyway).
UPDATED Switching to ISO auto and back to manual now resets the exposure time
        to default.
UPDATED Debug info now includes device language setting.
UPDATED Default to FullHD rather than higher video resolutions, if possible.

Version 1.28.1 (2016/03/30)

FIXED   Crash when going to "Photo settings" on devices with Czech language
        (bug introduced in 1.28).

Version 1.28 (2016/03/25)

FIXED   Broadcast File-based Uri when using Storage Access Framework, instead
        of SAF Uri (this fixes Owncloud crashing for auto-upload photos/videos
        option; this might also fix problems with photos/videos not showing up
        on SD card until after a reboot?)
FIXED   Unable to get location from network providers on some pre-Android 6
        devices (e.g., Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 7) since v1.27 due to Android OS
        bug, have worked around this.
FIXED   If using Storage Access Framework, and save location was on external SD
        card, the on-screen free memory would show internal storage. (Note that
        with this fix, it may be that the free memory is not shown for external
        SD cards, but that's better than showing an incorrect value.)
FIXED   Toast for hitting max filesize on video recording wasn't shown for very
        long.
FIXED   Was incorrectly showing "n repeats to go" toast even if it wasn't going
        to repeat (e.g., due to user stopping video recording).
FIXED   Use unicode character for degrees symbol (fixes warning in Android
        Studio).
FIXED   Corrected content description of take photo icon for when switched to
        video mode (for accessibility).
FIXED   Don't show thumbnails of earlier photos/videos when device is locked.
FIXED   Fixed various FindBugs errors.
ADDED   New options to take photo/record video by making a noise, or responding
        to the voice command "cheese".
ADDED   Option to control maximum filesize of videos.
ADDED   New option to disable performing auto-focus on startup (disable this if
        you have the bug where flash turns on on startup).
ADDED   Belarusian translation (thanks to Zmicer Turok).
ADDED   Czech translation (thanks to Jaroslav Svoboda).
ADDED   Japanese translation (thanks to Mitsuse).
ADDED   Turkish translation (thanks to Serdar Erkoc).
UPDATED Video now automatically restarts (rather than stopping) if the device's
        maximum filesize (typically ~2GB), or the user specified limit, is hit.
        (Option also added to not restart, if you prefer.)
UPDATED Don't show info toasts so often - only if an unusual non-default
        setting is set, or when switching between photo and video modes.
UPDATED Improved quality of take photo/video icons.
UPDATED Improved look of focus indicator.
UPDATED Display countdown timer as hours:minutes:seconds when 60 seconds or
        more.
UPDATED No longer show pointless toast for stopping video recording.
UPDATED Display if face detection is turned on in info toast.
UPDATED Level line now has a crossbar to indicate the vertical angle better.
UPDATED Reorganised the Settings ("Lock screen when recording video" moved to
        "Video settings", "Rotate preview" moved to "On screen GUI").
UPDATED Minor performance improvement to startup time.
UPDATED Condense popup view by combining some titles into the buttons.
UPDATED Updated Chinese Simplified translation (thanks to Michael Lu).

Version 1.27 (2015/10/25)

FIXED   Crash on Android 6 when accessing popup menu.
FIXED   Crashes on Android 6 if users have denied permissions (currently Open
        Camera won't request permissions at runtime, and please don't expect
        well-defined behaviour if you've blocked a permission, this is a quick
        fix to prevent crashes).
FIXED   Problems when holding down volume/focus/camera key to focus.
FIXED   Camera2 API photos sometimes taken before focused; autofocus square
        sometimes turned green immediately before focus actually succeeded.
FIXED   Take photo icon would momentarily switch to video icon when going to
        settings.
FIXED   Video bitrates now correctly documented as bps rather than bits.
ADDED   3 second option for timer/repeat mode.
ADDED   German translation (thanks to Ronny Steiner and Sebastian Ahlborn).
UPDATED Improved selfie stick button support (thanks to Lau Keat Hwa).
UPDATED Improved icons for app, and take photo (thanks to Adam Lapinski).

UPDATED Updated Russian translation (thanks to Vitamin).

Version 1.26 (2015/07/06)

FIXED   Crash in Camera2 API to do with focusing.
FIXED   Crash in Camera2 API when camera not available.
FIXED   Crash if pressing volume keys to change exposure when camera couldn't
        be opened.
FIXED   Taking photo would sometimes hang if flash on, and taking a photo
        whilst already focusing.
FIXED   "Show thumbnail animation" preference was ignored since v1.24.
FIXED   Saving of Exif tags (including GPS compass direction) now handled
        properly when Open Camera is called via another app to take a photo
        (note that some 3rd party apps may still override the Exif tags).
FIXED   Was sometimes displaying "0" for timer countdown and playing a beep
        when taking a photo on timer.
FIXED   If a photo was taken before startup autofocus completed, flash was
        incorrectly turned off.
FIXED   If torch is on, don't turn it off and on when Open Camera is starting
        up.
FIXED   Now switches to photo mode automatically when called from a photo
        intent (ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE, ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE_SECURE,
        INTENT_ACTION_STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA,
        INTENT_ACTION_STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA_SECURE).
FIXED   Reenable exposure compensation when using non-default ISO for original
        Camera API.
ADDED   Support for Android 5's Storage Access Framework. This should allow
        saving to SD cards, but has to be enabled under Settings/More camera
        controls/"Use Storage Access Framework".
ADDED   New option "Touch to capture" - take photos by touching or
        double-tapping anywhere on the preview.
ADDED   New option to allow disabling "toast" messages.

        when camera is nearly level.
ADDED   Option for mono or stereo audio when recording video (stereo only
        supported on some devices).
ADDED   Support for INTENT_ACTION_VIDEO_CAMERA intent (so Open Camera can now
        be launched in video using OK Google's "record a video") and
        ACTION_VIDEO_CAPTURE.
ADDED   Support for ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE_SECURE intent.
ADDED   Optional voice countdown for timer.
ADDED   Info toast now shows if timer and/or burst mode enabled.
ADDED   More repeat mode intervals, now up to 2 hours.
ADDED   New "Text style" option to render "stamp" text without a shadow
        background effect.

Version 1.24 (2015/04/18)

FIXED   Problem on Nexus 6 where torch didn't turn off until going to flash
        off mode (this came back again - possibly due to Android 5.1 update!).
FIXED   Problem that a toast wouldn't clear if new toasts were repeatedly
        created.
FIXED   Toast for changing exposure compensation is no longer on top of the -/+
        buttons.

        nearly level (for accessibility).
UPDATED Level angle no longer flips between "-0.0" and "0.0" when near zero

Version 1.23 (2015/02/16)

FIXED   Some devices (Nexus 5, Nexus 6) had dark preview/photos in low light,
        and frame rate not as smooth as it could be in good light.
FIXED   Problem on some devices (including Nexus 5 and Nexus 6) where torch
        didn't turn off until going to flash off mode (have actually fixed it
        this time!).
FIXED   Crash on some Sony Xperia devices when in video mode.
FIXED   Fix for devices where there is no write access for DCIM (thanks to

FIXED   If GPS lost, old possibly out of date position was still being used.
FIXED   Gallery now shows/goes to latest image/video in the chosen Open Camera
        save folder, rather than the latest image/video on the device. Also
        fixed problem if there existed a file with a datestamp in the future -
        these are no longer shown, even if located in the save folder.
FIXED   Some devices displayed "ISO ISO100" etc on popup menu.
FIXED   Pressing "No" to "Clear Save History" left screen as all black.
FIXED   Don't created corrupted video file if video recording stopped too
        quickly after starting (when no video data is received).
FIXED   Font size used for date/geo stamping photos now scales sensibly with
        photo resolution.
FIXED   Thumbnail created after taking a photo didn't always reflect actual
        image saved, if using auto-stabilise or date/geo stamp options.
FIXED   Popup button wasn't being hidden in immersive mode, on devices with
        flash.
FIXED   Don't show "Force 4K UHD video" option if 4K mode is already supported
        by the device in the standard video resolutions.

ADDED   Audio source can now be set to "default" or "Optimised for voice".
UPDATED GPS listener now prefers GPS provider to Network provider if both are
        available.
UPDATED GPS listener now sets min time of 1s, to improve battery usage.
UPDATED Now uses Material Design theme style on Android 5.
UPDATED Now uses dark theme for Settings (more consistent with rest of app;
        better for not ruining night vision; sorry if you preferred the old
        look, but Android doesn't seem to cope well with mixing themes in the
        same Activity).
UPDATED "Photo and video settings" preference screen now split up into "Photo
        settings", "Video settings" and "Location settings".
UPDATED Exposure level now displayed in units of "EV".

        are non-default.
UPDATED Popup menu now supports horizontal scrolling if there are too many
        flash, focus or ISO buttons.

        resolution.
UPDATED Switching resolutions from popup menup is now smoother.
UPDATED Removed android.hardware.camera.autofocus as being a required feature
        (this meant Open Camera didn't show up in Google Play on devices
        without auto-focus camera).

Version 1.22 (2015/01/04)

FIXED   Crash if camera couldn't be opened, and GUI buttons were pressed.
FIXED   Crash that could occur if camera closes whilst taking a photo.
FIXED   Crash on Galaxy Nexus in rare circumstances when switching camera.

        some cases (if using auto-stabilise, geotagging or stamp photo
        options).
ADDED   New immersive mode (requires Android 4.4 KitKat or higher), under
        Settings/On screen GUI/Immersive mode. You can set the option to use
        KitKat's immersive mode, either hiding the GUI, or even hiding
        everything except the camera preview. Touch the preview or swipe in
        from side to exit immersive mode. Also added an option to not even dim
        the on-screen virtual navigation buttons.
ADDED   Option to reset all settings to default.
ADDED   Options to control whether time and/or battery status are displayed
        on-screen.
ADDED   Can now set burst mode to unlimited.
ADDED   New option to only allow taking photo/video if GPS location data is
        available.
ADDED   Tagging photos with GPS direction is now a separate option ("Store
        compass direction" rather than "Store location data"). If you are
        upgrading and want photos to remain tagged with GPS direction, please
        enable the new option.
UPDATED Can now choose new save location from recent save folders picker.
UPDATED Improved look of recent save folders picker.
UPDATED Popup menu button now also shows indicator for torch.
UPDATED If camera only supports one scene mode etc, no point offering the
        option to the user.
UPDATED "Take Photo" shortcut is now done as a widget rather than a shortcut
        (if you previously had this shortcut on your homescreen, you may need
        to re-add it as a widget).

Version 1.21 (2014/11/15)

FIXED   Broadcasts of Camera.ACTION_NEW_PICTURE, com.android.camera.NEW_PICTURE
        and Camera.ACTION_NEW_VIDEO intents weren't supplying the Uri correctly
        - auto-uploading for photos and videos with Owncloud should now work.
FIXED   Corrected look of popup animation when in left-handed UI mode.
FIXED   If called via an intent, and returning the bitmap via a parcel, the
        bitmap wasn't being resized to a small size if auto-stabilise option
        was enabled.
ADDED   Option to stamp photos with date and time; and also GPS if location
        data is enabled.
ADDED   New application shortcut "Take Photo", which automatically takes a
        photo after opening Open Camera.
ADDED   Lock screen widgets, to allow calling Open Camera from the lock screen,
        and taking a photo from the lock screen (requires Android 4.2).
UPDATED Popup menu button now shows flash indicator (for flash auto or on).

        selected from the popup menu (ISO, white balance, scene mode, color
        effect, auto-stabilize).
UPDATED New material design icon.

Version 1.20 (2014/09/21)

FIXED   Crash (NumberFormatException in Parameters.getPreviewFpsRange()) on
        startup for mb526.
FIXED   Problems if settings window was opened while timer was active (timer is
        now cancelled when going to settings).
ADDED   New popup menu, allows quick access to changing: flash, focus, ISO,
        white balance, scene mode, color effect, camera resolution, timer.
UPDATED New icon (by Cosmin Saveanu).

Version 1.19 (2014/09/08)

FIXED   Crashes on startup due to invalid parameters being set.

UPDATED Improved look of toasts to match Android 4.4 look.
UPDATED Made changing resolution on the popup menu smoother - now possible to
        quickly go through the resolutions without a pause every time.
UPDATED Removed some pointless toasts.

Version 1.18 (2014/08/28)

FIXED   Problem on some devices (including Nexus 5) where torch didn't turn off
        until going to flash off mode.
FIXED   Problem on some devices (e.g., Galaxy S5) if in video mode, and focus
        mode is not continuous, and user went to settings and back, then tried
        to record - video would hang.
ADDED   Spanish translation (thanks to Mario Sanoguera).
UPDATED If camera can't be opened, touching the screen now tries to reopen the
        camera.
UPDATED Allow installation of app onto external storage.

Version 1.17 (2014/08/24)

FIXED   Crash during auto-stabilise if unable to rotate bitmap (out of memory?)
        now instead reports being unable to auto-stabilise.
FIXED   Crash if failed to start camera preview.
FIXED   Crash when changing flash mode, if camera was lost.
FIXED   Problem where photos were being taken out of focus on some devices (bug
        introduced in v1.16).
FIXED   "Save location" option didn't work if folder didn't exist (this also
        meant it didn't work when the app is first installed, unless a
        photo/video was taken first) (bug introduced in v1.16 with the new file
        chooser dialog).
ADDED   New options for volume keys: focus, and switch auto-stabilise on/off.
UPDATED Allow changing flash mode while recording video (so torch can be
        switched on and off).
UPDATED Zoom -/+ controls are now disabled by default, to reduce clutter (for
        those upgrading, you can change this in Settings/On screen GUI).
UPDATED Use more subtle/natural colors for red/green/blue in UI; improve look
        of take photo/video icon.

Version 1.16 (2014/08/17)

FIXED   Device freeze when recording video on some Samsung devices (e.g.,
        Galaxy S2, and some Galaxy S3 variants).
FIXED   Fail to take photo if in manual focus mode, and picture was taken
        whilst focusing.
FIXED   Changing left/right handedness of UI didn't update until app
        paused/resumed.
FIXED   Problems with left-handed UI when going to settings and back, icons
        would shift to incorrect positions.
FIXED   When geotagging was enabled, this didn't take effect until the app was
        paused and resumed (or restarted).
FIXED   If zoomed in, then switch camera or app paused, the camera preview
        would reset to being unzoomed on some devices (e.g., Nexus 7).
UPDATED Save folder location is now chosen via a GUI, rather than having to
        type the path.
UPDATED If exposure is non-zero, the exposure is displayed on the photo/video
        toast.
UPDATED Photo/video toast now displays scene mode if not auto.
UPDATED Video toast now displays if audio recording is disabled.

Version 1.15 (2014/08/02)

FIXED   Crash when exiting settings, if camera wasn't opened (bug introduced in
        v1.14).
FIXED   More crashes due to camera drivers that aren't following Android API
        specs (Parameters.getFocusMode() should always be non-null, but isn't
        on some devices!)
FIXED   If video failed due to error (e.g., hitting device max filesize,
        running out of space, of other errors), Open Camera now stops properly
        rather than thinking the video is still recording. Last video error is
        also stored in the about/debug window.
ADDED   New option to lock orientation to portrait or landscape.
ADDED   New option Flash while recording video.
UPDATED Touch to set focus/metering now works while recording video.

Version 1.14 (2014/07/22)

FIXED   Crash when clicking to switch between photo/video modes if camera
        couldn't be opened.
FIXED   Problem with face detection not resuming after focusing on mtk6589.
FIXED   Workaround for aspect ratio bug introduced in Android 4.4.3:
        http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=70830
        Problem that this caused with aspect ratio with video recording.
FIXED   Open Camera now available as a choice when camera icon pressed from
        Gallery app (Open Camera now responds to
        android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA).
FIXED   Open Camera now available as a choice when camera icon pressed from
        Cover Lock Screen (beta) app (Open Camera now responds to
        android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA_SECURE).
FIXED   All available video resolutions are now supported.
ADDED   New "manual" focus mode - focusing happens when you touch the screen,
        but it doesn't do automatic focusing when taking a photo.
ADDED   Support for more hardware buttons: camera button to take photo/video;
        focus button; zoom in/out buttons.
ADDED   Long press on gallery icon now shows a popup of recent save folders (if
        more than one is available), allowing you to quickly change between
        them.
ADDED   Location data now stored in videos too, if geotagging option is enabled
        (only for MPEG4 and 3GPP video formats).
ADDED   Option for volume keys to do nothing (not even changing the device
        volume).
ADDED   Option to lock screen when recording video (swipe to unlock).
ADDED   Option to limit duration of recording video (automatically stops after
        specified time); also option to restart video a specified number of
        times.
UPDATED Significantly improved speed for opening and closing settings (now
        launched as a Fragment rather than a separate Activity).
UPDATED Open Camera now remains active rather than being blocked by a "screen
        lock" (face/PIN unlock still required to go to Gallery or Settings).
        This behaviour can be switched off by going to Settings/More Camera
        Controls/Show camera when locked.
UPDATED Broadcast Camera.ACTION_NEW_PICTURE and com.android.camera.NEW_PICTURE
        intents for new photos, and Camera.ACTION_NEW_VIDEO for new videos.
UPDATED WYSIWYG mode is now the default setting for the preview size.
UPDATED Expanded number of devices which show the "Force 4K UHD video
        (experimental)" option (remember, 4K isn't officially supported by
        Android API and this option is experimental - if this option shows, it
        doesn't necessarily mean it will work on your device).
UPDATED Video time is now shown with smaller font and off-centre, so as to not
        obscure the view so much.

Version 1.13 (2014/05/24)

FIXED   Crash when opening settings on devices that didn't support
        auto-stabilise (bug introduced in v1.10).
FIXED   Crash introduced in v1.10 to do with cancelling autofocus on some
        devices.
ADDED   Options for video bitrate and frame rate. Note that both of these are
        approximate settings, and whether they can be achieved may depend on
        your device, and other conditions such as lighting. Also note that
        setting non-default values for bitrate of frame rate may cause video
        recording to fail, if the values are not supported.
UPDATED About window now shows device manufacturer and model, to help with
        debugging.

Version 1.12 (2014/05/19)

UPDATED Improve support for ISO setting (didn't show up on some devices, e.g.,
        some Galaxy S5 variants).

Version 1.11 (2014/05/17)

ADDED   New GUI icon to set exposure lock.
ADDED   New option in settings to set ISO.
ADDED   Displays photo and video resolution etc, when starting up, switching
        between photo/video, and switching camera.
ADDED   About window now displays all camera parameters.
UPDATED Don't display switch camera icon if device only has 1 camera.
UPDATED Always reset to continuous focus mode when starting camera in video
        mode (fixes some problems on some devices).

Version 1.10 (2014/05/07)

FIXED   Preview wouldn't restart after taking photo with continuous focus, on
        Galaxy Nexus.
FIXED   Problems with aspect ratio when not using WYSIWYG preview mode and
        recording video.
FIXED   Camcorder profile was always being initialised from the back camera,
        even when recording video with the front camera.
ADDED   New (experimental!) option to support 4K UHD (3840x2160) video
        (Settings->Photo and video settings->Force 4K UHD video). Note that 4K
        video isn't properly supported by Android API, so this option may show
        even if it isn't supported on your device, and may not work or even
        crash. I've successfully tested this on a Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 3.
ADDED   Option to not display the -/+ zoom control.
UPDATED All available video resolutions offered by the camera are now supported.
UPDATED Picture and video resolution preferences display aspect ratio and
        megapixels of each resolution.
UPDATED Reorganised preferences into new On screen GUI page.
UPDATED Don't change camera settings whilst camera is autofocusing (may help
        problems/crashes on some devices).

Version 1.9 (2014/03/22)

FIXED   Crash on some devices when starting app or switching camera (bug
        introduced in v1.8).

Version 1.8 (2014/03/18)

FIXED   Crash on startup if Network or GPS location providers not available,
        and geotagging was enabled.
FIXED   Crash if specified save folder was an empty string.
FIXED   Don't ever turn on flash during autofocus when app is launched.
FIXED   Various other crashes.
ADDED   Option to not force screen display to maximum brightness.
ADDED   Option to display horizontal "level" line.
ADDED   Support for hardware menu button (now opens settings).
ADDED   Option to display a 4x2 grid (if you previously had a 3x3 "rule of
        thirds" grid, you'll have to reenable it under the Settings).
ADDED   Added privacy policy (for location permission/geotagging) to intro
        window text (needed for Nokia Store).
ADDED   Uses setRecordingHint, may improve performance of starting video
        recording.
ADDED   New About option in Settings, providing debug info.
UPDATED Don't re-autofocus before taking a photo, if camera recently
        successfully focused due to user touching the screen.
UPDATED Display yellow or green dot next to earth icon to indicate location
        accuracy.
UPDATED Display earth icon with red dash through it, if geotagging is enabled,
        but the app doesn't have a location.
UPDATED Current zoom is now saved when app goes idle, or switching cameras.
UPDATED Offset zoom slider slightly so as to not interfere with Google Now
        swipe.
UPDATED Allow greater range of characters (including unicode) for save location
        (now allows any character other than those reserved by filesystem).

Version 1.7 (2014/01/29)

FIXED   More fixes for aspect ratio - the preview display should now always
        have a 1:1 aspect ratio (on some devices this may mean black bars are
        shown, if there isn't a match between the camera's available preview
        sizes, and the aspect ratio of the device's display).
FIXED   Possible crash relating to creating thumbnails.
FIXED   Autofocus on startup didn't always actually focus.
FIXED   If camera doesn't support focus areas, but does support metering areas,
        still set the metering area.
FIXED   Was sometimes trying to set metering areas when metering areas not
        supported by device.
FIXED   If image is deleted after taking the photo, the thumbnail is now
        properly updated to what is now the most recent photo or video.
ADDED   New option to set preview aspect ratio to match the picture/video
        aspect ratio (WYSIWIG).
UPDATED Save folder can now be an absolute path, allowing possibility to save
        on external SD cards (though you need to know what the path is, which
        typically varies depending on device; I am unable to test this, so
        please let me know if it does or doesn't work).
UPDATED Zoom -/+ control now matches the zoom slider orientation.
UPDATED Hide some icons when taking video, as they don't do anything.

Version 1.6 (2014/01/20)

FIXED   Crash when trying to access image or video resolutions in settings, if
        camera didn't offer these settings.
FIXED   Exposure compensation wasn't available on devices if min or max
        exposure compensation level was equal to 0.
FIXED   Aspect ratio problems with the preview on some devices (if you are
        still having problems, please let me know what Android device you are
        using).
FIXED   Aspect ratio problems with the preview on all devices when switching
        the camera.
FIXED   Problem on smaller devices where on-screen text overlapped with take
        photo button; the text is now aligned to above the button on all
        devices.
ADDED   Zoom can now be also controlled via on-screen slider (next to the
        plus/minus zoom buttons).
ADDED   Option for volume keys to control the exposure compensation.
ADDED   Option to display compass direction of camera on-screen (defaults to
        on, disable it in options if you don't like it).
ADDED   Option to choose microphone for recording audio (support for external
        microphones).
UPDATED Exposure compensation is now set via a new button in the on-screen GUI
        (the black and white +/- symbol) instead of the settings. Clicking this
        will bring up a slider and plus/minus buttons to adjust the exposure
        compensation. To get rid of the slider and buttons, either click the
        Exposure button again, or click elsewhere on the screen.
UPDATED Geotagging now stores image compass direction (GPSImgDirection,
        GPSImgDirectionRef).
UPDATED Display degree symbol for displayed on-screen angles.
UPDATED Zoom control is now transparent.
UPDATED Filter applied to sensor for device angle.

Version 1.5 (2014/01/09)

FIXED   Crash on Android 4.4 when launching for first time, or changing the
        save folder (issue with creating the save folder, due to Android no
        longer allowing ANDROID_MEDIA_MOUNTED to be broadcast).
FIXED   Crash if failed to open camera after switching cameras, then user tried
        to zoom.
FIXED   Other potential crashes (NumberFormatException on "es209ra" on startup;
        RuntimeException on Xperia Go when taking photo; RuntimeException on
        "maxx_ax5" when taking photo with face detection).

Version 1.4 (2013/12/16)

FIXED   Calculation for focus areas wasn't right for front facing cameras.
FIXED   Exif data wasn't getting saved if auto-stabilise option was enabled
        (this also meant that on some cameras/focus modes, the orientation
        would have been incorrect).
FIXED   "Toast" pop-up messages looked poor on Android 4.4.
FIXED   Fixed potential crash if taking picture fails.
FIXED   Touch to focus with continuous focus shouldn't show red box.
FIXED   Crash with auto-stabilise for some angles larger than 90 degrees.
FIXED   Crash when rotating device when viewing "Photo and video settings".
FIXED   If device was rotated when app was idle, the UI sometimes showed with
        the incorrect orientation.
ADDED   Images now tagged with current location (optional, off by default). Note
        that Open Camera now requires Location permission, for this feature.
ADDED   Option for face detection.
ADDED   Touch to select focus area also now sets the metering area (used to
        determine exposure).
ADDED   Now displays current time.
ADDED   Option to display a 3x3 grid ("rule of thirds").
ADDED   Now displays flashy thumbnail animation when taking a photo (you can
        disable this in the options under "More camera controls..." if you
        don't like this sort of thing!)
UPDATED Gallery button now displays thumbnail of last image/video taken.
UPDATED Clicking the Gallery button now goes to most recent image/video.
UPDATED Made it easier to see on-screen text when underlying photo preview is
        bright, by drawing a background with the text.

Version 1.3 (2013/11/18)

FIXED   Video files may not have shown up properly in other apps, or over USB,
        until rebooting device.
FIXED   Make sure filenames for images/videos are unique.
ADDED   New burst mode option - take a repeated set of photos at once, or with
        a delay.
ADDED   Option for video resolution.
ADDED   Display battery status on screen.
UPDATED Reorganised settings screen to remove clutter - less commonly used
        options have been moved to sub-screens; "Record audio?" is moved to
        "Photo and video settings..."
UPDATED Only show zoom level (if that option is set) when actually zoomed in.

Version 1.2 (2013/11/09)

FIXED   Crash when launching gallery, if no Gallery app installed on device.
FIXED   Selecting a focus area shouldn't switch to focus mode auto.
FIXED   Focus area wasn't getting reset when it should (e.g., changing focus
        mode or zooming).
FIXED   Fixed potential crash on auto focus.
FIXED   Hide GUI options while taking a photo (otherwise problems can be caused
        by changing options, e.g., changing focus mode).
FIXED   Message for failing to open camera was too wide for portrait view.
ADDED   Option for exposure compensation.
ADDED   Show whether auto focus was successful or not (via red/green rectangle)
        even if focus area not selected.
UPDATED Pause after taking photo now defaults to false.
UPDATED Made "toasts" look nicer.
